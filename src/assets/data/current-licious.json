Portion of each pasta was small. The main course was the worst we ever had. The lamb chops were no bigger than a bottle cap each. The veggies that came with the main is 5 strands of asparagus with half a plate of more salad... Except this time the salad was without any dressing or toppings. Lastly, the service was definitely slow. No one checked on whether we wanted another drink or water throughout the entire meal. Definitely not impressed. We came here because it was noted to be the \"most authentic Italian in the city\". The taste might be authentic but the experience was far from a good European time."

Some real positives - attractive interior, comfortable table, friendly service, and quite reasonable prices (three-course plus coffee prix fixe for $45 pp, a wine list that had a lot of choices in the $36-42 range). The meal started with a complementary amuse-bouche. A basket of various breads with olive oil and olives were provided. Our romaine salads were excellent, a cut above the usual. Our mains (salmon and chicken breast) were both excellent, with great vegetable accompaniments. We both had gelato for dessert - tasty and presented with fresh fruit garnish. The only disappointment in the meal was the coffee - really weirdly weak, almost transparent, lacking in flavour (like what you get in the Midwest U.S.). One of us ordered decaf, the other regular - both coffees were the same in appearance and taste. Too bad - a weak ending to an otherwise perfect meal."

Had to ask about the burger, the server ask what the problem was & when it finally arrived it was clear that it was the original burger that had been left under the heat lamp too long.  The lettuce and tomato were both cooked.  When questioned about that he said that the meat patty always cooks the lettuce and tomato like that and that it is normal.  He finally took the burger off the bill.  There were 5 of us and we had asked for separate bills except for 1 couple who wanted theirs together.  When he brought the bills out the wrong two people were together.  When we all took out cash he did not take the cash and left to take care of other customers.  He did not return for about 10 minutes and then took about 15 minutes to return with our change.  We were here to celebrate a birthday but decided to go elsewhere to complete the evening due to our servers bad attitude and service.

We've usually ordered appetizers like mussels and some other items...they tasted great. Bar staff is very friendly, but they do get incredibly busy, so it's your typical bar...you may have to wait and it's difficult to talk since it get's noisy. I think if you get there after 9 pm, there is a cover...sometimes a bit inconsistent on the cover charge. I'm always amazed by the stupid men and women who either stand on the dance floor, but do NOT dance, or have their drinks or large purses with them. If you want to \"stand\", then move to off the dance floor so others can dance. If you're worried about your drinks, then finish them, before dancing and buy another one later...don't be cheap."

While the dishes are Italian, many of the ingredients (like black sesame, jalapeño, and tahini) are not. Amano offers classic Italian eats like Fat Tubes Rigatoni Bolognese with local Ontario beef and pork, with the focal point of the menu being a section Chef Angeloni has dubbed ‘Not Your Nonna’s Pasta’. Amano’s wine list includes Italian classics but is rounded off with Canadian offerings, which either focus on Italian wine making techniques or grapes themselves."

I honestly can’t say which is better, the fresh pasta, made in-house, or the warm and inviting atmosphere and staff. Sometimes it can be hard to find delicious vegetarian-friendly restaurants in the city, but Amano is not lacking in meat-free dishes. Although the appetizers are unbelievably simple and delicious, the stars here are the fresh pasta dishes, made in-house. To be honest, I don’t think I have had more delicious pasta ever. The restaurant’s philosophy is to make Italian food approachable, so the dishes are named after the shapes of the pasta, and not the official pasta names. The portions are big enough to feel satisfied, but not too heavy that you have to roll yourself out of the restaurant. The ingredients are fresh and local, which is what makes the meal so enjoyable. I have to say, I think Amano may be the best restaurant we’ve ever been to in Toronto. I can't say enough about the restaurant, the food and the staff. To Chef Mike, Kristina and the entire team, keep up the amazing work that you all do!"

The prices are a bit high but is it expected given the location. They are located inside the union station, which is extremely convenient if you want a quick eat before the train or before grabbing the UP. However, they are positioned more like a fancy sit down restaurant and it’s Hard to get this nice night out feel when you eat inside a train station... I have been to the restaurant a few times and the service is a hit or miss. Some waiters are extremely nice and make sure you get the level of service you have in a restaurant in that price range. However, some other servers forgot to bring our drinks, bread, never apologized for their lousy service and are simply rude... Nevertheless, I believe this place deserve 4 stars for their great pastas!!"

Their food is made fresh in house and the prices are very fair, especially for the portions, though what truly takes this place a step higher is the excellent service with a personal touch. The staff are all friendly, welcoming, and efficient, and I definitely appreciate the latte art in my morning cappuccino. Would definitely recommend!"

Reservation was made and we arrived on time and the restaurant was busier than normal as it was Mothers day but still quite a few tables that were empty. The service started out slow as the waiter did not take our order until about half an hour of us sitting there. Finally when he took our orders as he wrote them down we thought maybe things would change. However an hour into waiting we still had not yet received our appetizer and so we decided to ask. A lady came to our table and said the kitchen had been backed up and our food would come shortly. The food arrived after another 10 minutes, two of the orders was a steak, one of them supposed to be medium rare but came practically raw and the other was supposed to be medium well but also came pretty rare. The one order was supposed to be with rice as opposed to mashed potatoes. The worse possible service we could have ever gotten. We ate what we could and left as soon as possible. After we left, not long after 2 of the people who had ordered the fish did not feel good after and ended up with food poisoning for the rest of our night, one of them being my mother. Thanks for ruining our mothers day dinner. I don’t see us returning ever again."

The climate in the restaurant was just right, and the patio was very nice.  The patio took you to another place perhaps a back patio in France with nice decor, greenery, landscaping and stone work.  The restrooms were clean and well maintained.\n\nWe had an entree each and shared two sides including the salad and mushrooms.  The monkfish was delicious with the texture of lobster, but even better in my opinion.  The lamb with black garlic custard was tender throughout with absolutely no \"tough\" or gritty areas and nothing stuck in-between the teeth by the end of dining.   There was just the mildest and almost unnoticeable scent typical of lamb.  The meat was cooked medium rare and was of high quality.  A bottle of wine paired very well with the dinner and I recommend it for an occasion.   To sum it up: everything presented in each entree was art with harmonious flavours of the components.  Savoring every bite at a relaxed pace made this the perfect experience.  The plump olives were pickled in-house, and the bread was very fresh.  Unfortunately we were too stuffed to attempt dessert.\n\nChad was our charming and attentive waiter who never let our glass of water or wine deplete more than 1/3rd of the way to the bottom.  His suggestions were great and we took his word on the sides.  Andrew was assisting and also attentive and a pleasure to talk to.  They ensured that we were satisfied at all times, and they succeeded!  Their smiles were genuine as they enjoyed seeing us happy.\n\nThe 45m car ride at 6pm was well worth the occasion at Auberge du Pommier.  Thank you for making this one of my best dining experiences in a very long time!  Management, chef(s) and servers."

The tuna was so bland tasting we couldn’t finish it and the pizza was luke warm and tasted like the stuff you get from a grocery store. We were so upset that by the time the salmon came around, we had had enough. We tried one bite and left it; bland just like the tuna.  They had asked if we enjoyed the first half of the meal, to which we replied “it was very one note, not that good” and while she offered another dish, we ended up paying full price. You’d think because we left a taco, almost all of the dill and some of the pizza, the server might of clued in we early did not enjoy our meal but that was not the case. We paid almost $150 (full price even for the tacos which they knew we highly disliked) for our meal (3 drinks included) and I’m infuriated at myself for doing so. I have no problem spending money on good food but this was the worst meal I’ve ever had out."

The restaurant is super cute with excellent pastries. Not a whole lot of seating so you might have to prepare to wait. The service was alright, but even that couldn't take away from the delicious items. Would definitely go back either to this location or another one in the chain."

Instead, in this place you would have to wait around inside the restaurant/bar. In our example, we had to wait for 1.5 hours. I’m sure this is to ensure that you are not spending a dime outside of this place while you are waiting. I would have preferred the option so I could go across the street for a beer sitting down instead of drinking cocktails standing around a high table. \n2.\tFood taste and portion sizes don’t justify the price. In addition, at the price you pay for some of these plates (and I mean tiny plates here) you expect to get perfect dishes and they are not! The short rib skewer had 4 small pieces and 2 of them were mostly fat and very little meat. \n3.\tWhen we first started to order food, we were told that they were out of pizza doughs for the night. In about an hour after we ordered bunch of dishes, the waiter comes by and says they have 6 pizza doughs!!! Could it be that they wanted to make sure we maximize our spending and then offer dishes that are more filling???!!! I would think so…we ended up ordering a couple of pizza and again back to point #2, not worth it…."

I went with 6 girlfriends and they only have 3 six person tables, two people were sitting at one 🤦🏻‍♀️ so we were given this wobbly makeshift thing that can't even be described as a table because it was only a foot wide. We didn't have enough room for plates on the fada thing!\n\nI ordered an arugula salad (literally was just greens with nothing else) and the salmon (salmon covered in pesto with no sides, just the fish) and a water (tap!) And it came out to $40. The food was fine but not worth the money. \n\nThe restaurant only has high tops with really uncomfortable chairs, so if you're looking to sit and enjoy, go somewhere else.\n\nThe service was horrific. Our server was rude and arrogant. If we asked him a question about the menu he gave us a look like he couldn't be bothered and we were annoying him. \n\nOverall, a terrible experience. I would never go back. All of my friends were extremely disappointed."

They have more than a dozen home-brewed beers, most of them are worth trying, especially their fruitier drinks. Their food is mostly just for filler; get their chicken wings to-go if you're looking for a late night meal. \n\nIt's pretty loud indoors.

Then the experience was ruined as the attitude pricked up more than once over very simple requests that no one at the table was angry or in a rush over. \n\nAll in all the food WAS good, maybe a bit overpriced, maybe a little bit too portion controlled, but it was good. \n\nThe overall experience though was bad, no one in our party will be returning."

The quality of the ingredients and worse, their preparation was very mediocre at best. \n\nIf it's Japanese food you crave, there are many much better examples to be found, especially here in Toronto. \n\nIn the absence of a unique experience and solid quality food, save your $$$, not a repeat and not recommended."

They were cooked to medium rare and absolutely delicious. My husband had pasta and raved about it.

It wasn't very busy, but took forever for someone to greet us. The young hostess approached us and said she would be right with us. She proceeded to walk to the back and returned with a drink, and was just chatting and laughing at the bar. She then went to a table and took away their dishes and did not return. We waited another minute and just walked out. 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. Extremely disappointing. We went to the Cafe Grill next door and had a wonderful time. I really enjoy Biffs, but this left a sour taste in my mouth"

The food took a while because they said it was fully prepared fresh to order so don't come VERY hungry. The wine glass for a reasonably 6oz starts at $12.

Don, and the rest of the wait staff ensured that we had a great night, and the kitchen kept delivering great food.

They have a fixed 3 course brunch or order the regular way whatever you want. They also have drink specials charging mimosa's for $5 which is better priced than the regular $10 per glass.\n\nPatio is decent size with lots of umbrellas which is ideal for the summer weather.\n\nHighly recommend and will certainly be back again. Most definitely telling my friends about this place!\n\nThanks for an amazing brunch!"

Unlike other restaurants downtown they don't require a deposit or family style menu. They have prix fixe menus at different price points to cater to a wide range of dietary preferences. Their service is top notch. I always try to select this venue for any work related or personal events from just their service alone. The food is also delicious, in the wide range of dishes I've tried in all my visits. I'd highly recommend, their mushroom risotto and their lamb shank. For dessert, a slice of their pecan pie with ice cream is highly recommended."

She also had the souffle, which she personally didn't like, but I gave it a try and it was good!\n\nI ordered their venison wrapped in prosciutto, as it was their special of the night. It was absolutely exceptional. I had it medium rare and the second you cut into it, you know it's perfect. It had this delicious red hue and tasted very fresh and wonderful. The prosciutto also greatly complemented the dish. The dish comes with some roasted peppers and mushrooms, and is served on mashed potatoes and gravy.\n\nThe waiter was also extremely friendly and attentive.  I loved his enthusiasm. We had a great time, and would definitely be back."

I am willing to go again and re-rate but for my first time there, it was worth a 2 star.\n\nStarting off at the greeting at the door. Walking in, the whole front part of the restaurant was full due to a large party that had a reservation. Nothing bad. Just caught off guard. The waiters seemed confused by our presence. Granted we were multiple minutes early for our reservation. But it was still an awkward situation.\n\nWe ordered beverages. I tend to create cocktails on the fly depending what selection of liqueur the bar has. The staff seemed to be unfamiliar with the liqueur I had selected even though it was displayed on their bar rack. The creation  I made was quite delicious. I thank the bar tender who added the raspberry garnish. Good choice!\nA sample of appetizers were offered with bread, while we waited for our food. I am a picky eater so my opinion on these samples will not be helpful to anyone. As for the main course, I ordered the beef rib. The beef itself was a little overcooked, the seasonal vegetables were good, but nothing particularly special. The mashed potatoes were creamy but a little on the dry side. What probably saved the dish was the delicious sauce it came in. Seriously just mix the sauce into every bite.\nDuring our meal, a few empty plates and used cutlery were dropped on the way back to the kitchen. When it was time to pay, the bills were mixed up and not the typical distribution error, the order on the receipt was mismatched. Ratified quickly in any case.\n\nOverall, just an awkward first impression. The ambiance of the place has a warm cozy feel to it, and even if the staff seemed confused, they were good and dutiful."

It has the feel of an upscale speakeasy due to its location in the basement of the TD centre. It has no windows but the decor of dark woods and dim lighting certainly makes it feel cozy. Nice place to have a business lunch. \n\nThey've tried to change it up with an aged burger but still go for their classic burger which is topped with mushrooms and truffles for $40. The patty is cooked medium and is just right to keep the meat moist and flavourful. The fries are also excellent."

The jackfruit pulled pork was amazing and with the size of fries it was the perfect mouth feel. I asked for mustard, but would be great if they served with a bit of BBQ dipping sauce.

Went for a Wednesday lunch, 2 of us fish stew and mussels plus a starter and 2 glass (wine Wednesday with $5 glass) just under $120 all included. The fish stew is really good, the only thing if I would complain is there are 2-3 mussel is a bit out of taste. While it happen to mussel some time. My friend did not complain her mussel so it probably just I got a few bad ones. Will definitely order fish stew again minus mussels. \n\nBtw I love the outdoor sitting can’t wait summer is back."

When entering the building, don’t wait in the line for the actual museum but just walk through and if they ask, tell them your here for Clay Restaurant. \n\nSo let’s get started with the service. Super awesome people that work here. They greeted us and the then around with your ordering with food is in great timely fashion. The decor of this place is super modern and comforting. \n\nThe food itself, it’s super awesome.

When we requested forks, he obliged us, but also stated: \"Usually people eat these with their fingers -- that's why I didn't bring you any.\" \n(iv) He did not ask about our meal until the latter part of the meal, so I had 2/3 of my fish and chips without ketchup.\n(v) He did not offer cream or milk with our teas, until prompted.\n(vi) Upon our paying the bill, he maintained the iPad in his hands as we selected the tip amount. This had the effect of rushing our decision, and we observed how he would offer the iPad TO THE CUSTOMER at neighboring tables.\n\nThese inconsistencies were irritating albeit small, but in accumulation, left us distracted by the level of service. The timing was unfortunate as we were also celebrating a belated Mother's Day. We still recommend this establishment as the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot."

However, I would definitely come back to grab a delicious cocktail or two but would probably avoid getting a steak.\n\nCame here for Mother's day brunch(small tip: call a week or two in advance for reservations this place fills up quick.\n\nFirst let me start by saying this place is beautiful the decor is clearly French cafe inspired which gives off a classic and romantic atmosphere. A perfect place for date nights or if you want to treat someone to a nice place.\n\nThe staff from our server to the hostess were pleasant and a joy to talk to. They were honest of their favourite things on the menu and were incredibly helpful when we had questions.\n\nUnfortunately the food is where I start to take off some stars. I ordered a steak and eggs, the eggs cooked perfectly no complaints there. However, if anyone is a steak lover you know that you should not cut a steak before serving since it dries out the meat. \n\nOn top of that the fries were definitely a bit stale. But the garlic mayo that accompanied the fries were amazing and would dip everything in it.\n\nTo end off the meal I decided to randomly try a cocktail. The cocktail was delicious and almost made me forget my disappointment in my meal."

I decided to host my baby shower there and it did not disappoint. Leading up to the day of the event, Elizabeth was a pleasure to work with. She was kind, attentive and responded quickly to my many questions. On the day of the event, Janella and Chris met our every need. They were organized, respectful of our guests and took the utmost care to make sure everything was just as it should be. The food was absolutely spectacular (my guests are still talking about it!) and no cup of coffee was left to go cold throughout the entire event! I even noticed a member of the staff going around to tables before our guests arrived to make sure there were no marks on the silverware. It is this type of focus that really elevates a venue. The atmosphere was perfect and the attention to detail was of the highest quality. If you are looking for an intimate and beautiful location to host a special event - look no further."

You defiantly feel like you’re in the mall so in terms of ambiance it’s not great. It’s like being in a slightly better version of the food court. The food was good though and I think for a mall this is a great place to go. We tried both versions of the high tea, I don’t think the oeelin upgrade was worth it. If you do love the experience of high tea I wouldn’t recommend this particular place just because ambiance plays a big part in the enjoyment of high tea. The food itself was good so we’ll probably come back as a lunch or dinner option if we are walking around there."

It is a bit pricey on Sundays so nice for special occasions (or if you can splurge just cause!) but the amount, quality and variety of food you get is so good! Fresh seafood, shrimp and oysters are amazing! I also had a mushroom eggs benedict, delicious! Salads, salmon wellington, etc etc and then desert!!... everything was so good...prepare for a nap after though lol...definitely worth going!"

The afternoon tea however, was a grave disappointment! 😖 I was so excited to eat there and was heavily let down by the finger sandwiches. I had the smoked salmon, egg sandwich, cucumber sandwich and avocado toast... It says a lot when your avocado toast has the MOST flavour... the sandwiches were just in white bread, had little to no flavour and the ratio of filling to bread was just not what I had expected at all. I actually had to ask for salt and pepper just so I felt like I was eating more than plain bread. The desserts on top were all chocolate based (except the macarrons)... And I'm not a very big chocolate lover... but there were no other options. The scones I will say were delicious! I enjoyed and asked for more, but strawberry and marmalade are your only jam options..."

While the food was good and the atmosphere nice, the service was very poor. The impression I get was that the Hoggs Hollow crowd is served better than anyone else. Waiting 15 minutes to order dessert? Watching every other table get their fish served to them by one server while two others stood by for the presentation. The 'floater,\" for the night was the best server because she saw our frustration and created a bill for us right away. Might have been our lame duck look at the table that she saw for 15 minutes. Coppi would be disappointed. If you can't serve then move aside. Much better options in the city right now. I want to like this place better but right now can only hope they improve."

As we went in the hostess explained that they were booked starting at 6 for the Raptors play off game. We told her that was no problem. The server Kim took our drink order quickly. And the beers were brought over fast.  They were delicious.  The server then took about 25 minutes to even take our food order. In this time we watched another table have their entire meal. When we ordered an app to start and our meals. The app was brought out with the mains.  This was very disappointing. On top of this we sat with our entire meal with empty water glasses. We were not even offered any additional condiments to go with the burgers and fries that we ordered. The food was delicious. But the service was atrocious. At the end (an hour before their bookings filled up)  we were  asked if we wanted dessert or other drinks. We said that we were unsure. And the server Kim proceeded to bring us the bill.  Very disappointed by this horrible service that brought down what would have been a fantastic meal otherwise."

The beer list is great, and admittedly I haven't had food so don't take that into account.\n\nNow, if you sit on the bar wood the service is pretty good, fairly prompt. HOWEVER, when we sat at a table the service was absolutely horrendous. 10 minute wait to be approached (due to \"changing sections\"). 20 minutes to get a drink. Asked for the bill and had to eventually just get up and find our server to ask again. Sadly, from other colleagues I've talked to this is par for the course.\n\nIf you're going with one or two others to sit on the bar, sure. If not, absolutely don't go here."

Not terribly pricey either, but if you hit the wine and somewhat exotic (but awesome) beer selections they offer you'll reach your dining out budget cap quickly.  \nI attended a corporate event with about 20 people and the service was very slow that evening even though the restaurant wasn't that busy.  My waiter missed an offered refill that night, but the food was amazing and cooked perfectly - so it was almost worth the wait.  I definitely would go again to give them another chance at better service."

The heirloom tomato dish is one of the best starters in town. My partner has had both the striploin and the short ribs; both are delicious and I would happily have eaten a whole bowl of the zucchini side that came with the ribs. I sometimes shy away from ordering fish because it can be tasteless, but Figo cooks and seasons it perfectly. The total bill usually comes to around $130, including a shared app, drink each, two entrees and two desserts, which is what we expect to pay for a thoughtfully prepared meal in a casual, upscale place. We live in the West end of Toronto and there are tons of great restaurants nearby. But we'll happily hop on the streetcar again soon to eat at Figo!"

The reviews were good and I was expecting a different experience.\n\nThey didn't have 3 dishes available, which is hard with a small menu. One of the dishes was the dish they're well known for, the octopus. They didn't tell me until after the order was placed so there really wasn't anything else I wanted to eat. I ended up get the grilled sardines instead which were just salted and grilled. Really boring and overcooked. I'm fine with a simple dish but then it's really got to be good.\n\nWe got a soup and burrata for appetizers, and a chocolate cake for dessert. All of which were average, nothing special.\n\nThe only saving grace for this restaurant was the rabbit pasta. The sauce was really delicious and rich. Sadly my husband also got 3 bones in his pasta.\n\nThe place was completely empty during our visit at lunch, I think that's says a lot... I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend it.. sadly."

The restaurant did not charge me for it, but still unfortunate to look forward to dining in a place like this and be served something not remotely chewable. The 3 other guests in my party did enjoy their meals."

Unfortunately, this year the Windsor Arms was disappointing for several reasons. It felt like being on an assembly line and being in a mechanized cash grab of a day and given the sharp increase in pricing for Mother’s Day service, one would hope they could maintain the high level of service befitting a five star hotel. The service was cold and impersonal and there was little attention paid to us as customers. The food was stale and a step down from previous years. Their afternoon tea service used to be the best in the city. Can’t say I would ever return for tea. Definitely put a bit of a damper on a special day."

My sister asked if one of the dishes was vegetarian, which was met with a really rude and sarcastic remark. My mom asked if the dish she wanted was very spicy and could be modified - again, was responded to in a very rude manner. I usually don't care about service as long as the food is good, but this really was a stand-out experience in terms of rude service. The waiter was so impatient, rude and seemed like he wanted us out of there. If you hate your job THAT much, quit - or at least, don't work with people! I was taken aback at how rudely he was talking to us...\n\nOn the plus side, food was AMAZING. Best butter chicken I've ever had. Biryani was too spicy for me (but that's personal taste). \n\n5/5 for food, 1/5 for service"

My Friend asked for separate bills and the server said \"its very hard\" why don't you calculate and i will charge separately. I checked the bill and it wasn't our bill to begin with. Then I insisted that we need separate bill and server said \"I will have to do it 6 (counting my 3 yrs old which i mentioned will not be paying his own bill) times, its will take very long for me\", I said that is fine, we can wait. He came back with the bills, handed me the bundle and said \"now you can sort it out who's bill is which\"... I mean are you serious? you are the one who took our orders and should know who ordered what. \n\nAnyways, then he charge an extra $10 on the credit card, I checked and pointed that out and he sounded irritated, did another transaction, again, wrong amount, no apologies, but even more irritated reaction by him .\n\nLong story short, you cannot charge me 18% gratuity (yes it came in the bill) for such bad service.

By now, main food would have to be delicious to curb our building sour appetites. Unfortunately, food is prepared like someone in the kitchen forgot they're open and rushed cook time.

Both were super flavourful and made vegan. The one thing that was a little concerning; I asked for vegan meals and while the base was, I was still served creamy coleslaw and dipping sauces that were not vegan friendly. Lucky for us, my husband loves slaw, but a lot of food still went to waste.\nIf someone asks for vegan, it should all be vegan. \nOther than that, the curry was super yummy and their hot sauce has a great tang to it. We’ll be going again on a music night for sure."

I mentioned it to the older guy at the front desk and he laughed at me and assured me noone had died in there recently..... As if things could not get worse, there was a party or wedding or something which kept me awake till almost 1 o'clock in the morning. When I got up to check the \"continental breakfast\", it consisted of cereal, milk, coffee and what I can only assume was orange juice (looked more like egg nog). That is not worth 5$ in my opinion. All the warning signs were there, but I still decided to eat a snack the next day. The \"sliders\" were more like garlic and ground meat slapped together and cooked. Although they tasty, they were way too heavy on the garlic. I ended up being sick the day, which I attribute to the sliders or some combination of what I ate and drank at the hotel. My martini glass was dirty, the ketchup bottle had ketchup all over the side, the list goes on. To make matters worse, I had to go up to the bar and ask for a glass of water, then I had to go up to order my beverage, again to order my food, and lastly to pay my bill even though they have handheld machines. By the way, I was the only person in the restaurant... The lack of service and quality at this place is astonishing. I am surprised they are still in business. I will not be returning."

Nice selection of quality red wines. \n\nThere’s just one problem:  this place is insanely loud.  There are reflective surfaces everywhere and no sound absorbing materials at all.  At peak time when the place is full it is almost impossible to carry on a conversation and after a 2 hour dinner, my ears are literally ringing.  My wife and I found it very uncomfortable to be there and our party of 4 were unable to talk without yelling, which of course only made the problem worse.\n\nGreat restaurant, ruined by horrible acoustic properties.  They desperately need to drape something from the ceiling or add some baffles or something.  Unbearable."

When I received my glass, I saw that the glass was dirty with remaining lipstick marks on the rim. No big deal, so I simply relayed this to the bartender with \"Hi, I noticed the glass is dirty. May I please have another one instead.\" To which, the bartender snatched the glass from me, turned and slammed it on the back counter.\n\nI was stunned that this was her reaction. No apology and the attitude?!\n\nTo my horror, she then proceeded to try to transfer the wine content from the dirty cup to a new cup. Gross! At which point, I motioned for her to stop and said \"nooo\". This caused more fury from her - more slamming, dirty looks - to the point that when I received my new glass, there were wine drops dropping down the side from her aggressiveness...\n\nLa Societe, is this the type of experience and service you want your customers to experience? Do you think this was professional of your staff at all?"

We got the tasting menu (mine was vegetarian), and the goat cheese tart was way too sweet (marmalade overpowered all the other flavours) and so was the palette cleanser (felt like eating a spoon of raw sugar - the server even asked me if I wasn't eating it because it was too sweet and that they hear this from customers a lot!). I got the vegetarian spring roll and my friend got the cheeseburger one. Hers came in a nice bowl on a pedestal, easily accessible. Mine came in a caged dish with handles over it on four sides. The chef recommends eating it with the lettuce wrap - how are you supposed to put your hands through the handles to eat the springroll, while the sauce is dripping down your fingers and you're trying to hold it over the plate within the cage??? Too bad there was a lack of thought in the execution since this item was actually delicious. A simple plate would have been fine. The sauce with the asparagus was very salty. Overall, the presentation of the vegetarian dishes was not as well done as the meat dishes. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, but the flavours and presentation could be improved. I would not recommend coming here."

The tables are very close together, small and without tablecloths.  The restaurant is very busy and loud so it’s not great for a romantic night out.  I had the Singapore slaw, it was different but not so memorable that I would want to try it again. The rest of the meal was nothing special. For dessert I had the signature French and Chinese Tong Yuen. Interesting presentation but left a too-sweet aftertaste that lingered and was unpleasant.  Service is fine and efficient but gives the impression of an assembly line.  The servers rattle off ALL of the ingredients in the slaw and repeat it at every table around you.  Maybe this place is good for a casual drink with friends on the outside patio."

You can instantly taste how fresh and thoroughly done the food was.\n• The lady serving us was a gem. Very attentive, always smiling, and served us as fast as she could.\n• A live jazz band generated a vibrant atmosphere around the place.\n• Honestly thought the price was very fair for the quality and quantities served.\n• Very neat inner decor.\n\nCons:\n• The food could take some time to get to the table, but that's because of it's freshness.\n• Thought the lighting in the place was way too dim.\n\nAll in all though, I really liked my experience. Will definitely come here again sometime in the future!"

What's bringing down my review is the quality of the service and cocktails.  It is a wine bar, so can't be too judgy about the cocktails, but service was super slow, and unprofessional for a place with a fairly high price point.  So many other great restaurants in the city so probably won't be returning."

We ordered the platter appetizer which was every bit enjoyable. Dinners were fantastic too, I had the lamb, everyone else was pleased with theirs as well... But that's as far as it goes. For a Saturday night with \"live entertainment\" the place was empty. So the atmosphere lacked. We ordered drinks, a mambo loco, which promised to be a concoction of alcohol, tangy pineapple juice and hot sauce for a kick. It was just burning spicy rum... Very disappointing. Dessert was even more lack luster. I had shared the chocolate cake, which simply ended up being a slice of Costco's tuxedo cake: at the same price as if I had bought the whole cake. My friends has the flan and the creme brulee which are hard to mess up, yet we're bland and the creme brulee was over cooked. The most disheartening part of the evening however was the speed of service, especially in a nearly empty restaurant. Our appetizer and drinks weren't served to us until we had been there nearly an hour. Mains were slow to arrive as well, and dessert just seemed the be the \"icing on the cake\". Somehow the bills seemed to be at the table within minutes of dessert being served though."

Hands down the best brunch I've had in Toronto. Impeccable service and extraordinary food and drink. We both had Lattes and shared the daily scone (maple almond) and it came with cream and blueberries. We had the Brunch to Share for $22/person which included toast, scrambled eggs, thick cut bacon, sausage, corned beef hash, baked beans, potatoes, roasted tomatoes and mushrooms. We couldn't decide what we liked more because everything was phenomenal... Not one dish was a misstep. Also came with 3 sauces... Highly recommend the brown sauce and the hot sauce. So much food - - generous portions. Can't wait to try dinner. We will be running back again and again!"

And that 55oz steak? Was a $30 roast. We requested it cooked rare... we received it cooked medium. If you want to sell a $300 portion of “steak”, please serve it bone in... I personally do not believe this was a steak at all. It came cut into 12 thin roast beef-like slices. Really disappointed. Would not recommend anyone order this gross misrepresentation and over priced “family style” serving."

My last two experiences there were with large groups who ordered multiple courses and all of us were disappointed with some aspect of our meals. For instance one of my favourite dishes is their escargot, and the past two times I have had it there the quality was not as good as it was before (not as creamy, watery). I had their duck and the skin was barely browned and hardly any of the fat underneath was rendered. My creme brule was liquid at the bottom. My mom had the pate, which used to come with a delicious multigrain toast, and now is served with a basket of untoasted grocery store imitation french loaf. I don't know if they switched chefs or management but I don't think I will be heading there again any time soon. It feels like someone is trying to cook french food from a recipe without any of the skills required or knowledge of what the end result should be."

There are so many traditional Thai dishes that you can't find in any other Thai restaurants. You can tell how good the place is by the amount of people lining up. Trust me, it's worth the wait. Plus, the restaurant is so well organized that you'll get you table within 20 minutes, no matter how busy it looks. All the staffs are super nice, friendly and helpful. Moreover, the restaurant is so well decorated. The owners, who are Thais, must have paid attention into details that even the plates and bowls they're using are from Thailand. The place is such a cozy and fun place that it's so perfect to chill and hang out with your friends. Highly recommended!!! If you are in Toronto, make a reservation in advance or just go. You don't wanna Miss it."

The fritto misto is light and crisp and their pizza is to die for. \n\nI would have never thought beet risotto would be SO good, but here it is. Their pasta? It’s the best!

I also believe in their concept of sourcing locally for the menu and the restaurant is hip & trendy. I recommended this place for a work function dinner. We had a couple great bottles of wine, but realized the restaurant doesn't really do cocktails because lemons/bitters cannot be sourced in Canada. We ordered the set taster menu, but the food took incredibly long. The server tried her best and she was lovely, but at the end of the day when it has been 2hrs for the seating and we still haven't had our mains, it is a bit unfortunate. The food was good, but it wasn't out of the ordinary. My favourite was the pate that was a part of the appetizers."

The food was not part of their regular menu as it was specifically chosen to pair with the four wines that were being poured. The chef (Guy Rawlings) created outstanding and unique dishes which were a perfect match for the wines. Prior to the event, Kim exchanged emails with me to see if we had any food sensitivities. The atmosphere was chill, the music eclectic and not loud. Probably not to everyone's taste, but if you're craving a unique food experience, highly recommended."

Our waitress started off very rude, was giving us mean faces and didn't care to tend our table well. We tried not to look into it much, but our drinks were late as were our food, sauces and extra condiments. One of my friends was not happy with her drink and asked if it was possible to be remade and her answer was \"I can do it again but it's going to taste the same regardless.\" Like who says that? Lastly when we were paying, many of us didn't care to tip her since she was so rude and not very helpful the entire night. When she realized they weren't tipping her she gave very mean glances at us. I decided to tip her and her mean glances continued but I got a thank you while the others didn't. Overall this waitress was TERRIBLE and I wish I got her name but unfortunately didn't.

Went to Museum Tavern because of the many reviews and blogs talking about this burger and wasn't disappointed. Museum Tavern is a nice place, not your average burger joint. About the burger itself: very tasty burger with two patties and amazing cheddar cheese. The quality of the meat is outstanding. The only thing that can be improved is the size: it's a rather small burger and the patties were a bit thin in my opinion. I'll definitely come back to try again."

The food is so delicious that I often try to arrange my meetings with friends there. \n\nI absolutely adore the elegant ambience that the interior design creates. Whoever did the interior designing deserves applause - the way that the wooden elements harmonize with the various wall textures, and lighting design adds to the overall dining experience. \n\nI love the spatial design as the tables and seats are spread apart well enough from other patrons, which gives me the comfort of knowing that I can have private discussions with whoever I'm dining with. \n\nI tried a few of the house-made concoctions, and I was impressed. I forgot the name of one of the drinks I had (I think it had yuzu in it?) but that was so tasty, I'm looking forward to ordering it again. \n\nLastly, I sincerely appreciated how friendly all the waiters were. When I asked for their opinions regarding a few dishes, they were informative and thoughtful. \n\nI strongly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal, atmosphere and time :)"

So I took my complaint to the hotel front desk where, after assuring me that they understood and agreed with me, went to discuss with the restaurant manager and came back stating that all is ok now and will credit my account.  I, thus, offered my credit card but they said \"no need; we have it online\".  Yesterday I received my CC statement and found that they actually did NOT credit my account.  A scam going on there???"

My liver was hard to eat because of the veins left in it, not to mention it was burnt.

We were sat directly beside an open window in torrential rain. It wasn't until an hour into our meal when the floor became dangerously wet that a server came over and shut the window. Service was spotty and it was hard to get anyone's attention. When we did order, drinks took over ten minutes and servers couldn't remember who ordered what. There were only six of us. They'd hold the tray and stare blankly as we organized the drinks among ourselves. Furthermore, some drinks came and others didn't. To ensure everyone was charged for what they received, we all asked for separate bills. The server looked annoyed and said it would just be easier if she bring us one bill and we work it out among ourselves. Quite unprofessional in my opinion. Food was fine. Nothing to rave about. Likely won't be coming back or recommending it to anyone."

The wine cellar is one of the best the city has to offer and the passion of the chefs excels. I have always had great attentive service. In the photos below are some of the great eats that I have had but the menu is always changing with the seasons. Positively Italian with a love for Ontario products. One of my loves is the huge emphasis they put on accommodating Vegans, Vegetarians and Gluten Free peeps with top of line menu experiences. I am so addicted to the zucchini ribbon pasta with vegan Bolognese. They can’t get this off the menu. Desserts are killer I just ate mine too fast to snap a photo. Next time, here’s hoping.

Extremely unpleasant dealing with the management and forcing us to pay more.

Servers walking by were very attentive to tables whether it was an empty plate, used cutlery or empty glasses... but having said that, Ryan really made this experience a memorable one. Not only was he super friendly, and always folded our napkins, but he was also very knowledgeable of wine and made GREAT recommendations for what to eat. We took his advice on everything and boy did he not steer us wrong!!!! My boyfriend and I were debating which dessert to get; Ryan suggested the Lemon Cheesecake (to die for amazing!) above the cappuccino ice cream- and he ended up bringing us both options, with the ice cream taken care of by him!!! We cant thank Ryan enough for this wonderful experience and we will definitely be back soon!!"

Service in general was really good and it was nice to have the waiter make suggestions for food/drink based on some of the dishes we were thinking.

One consideration...parking can be somewhat limited so consider Uber on the weekends.\nThe restaurant was not busy tonight so our reservation for four was honoured right on time and we were seated immediately. Our server - Lief - was extremely professional, efficient and pleasant. It's a family business so they are concerned that everything is right. We started with shared grilled calamari and battered shrimp...both excellent. Then we had the cowboy steak (18oz. and good for sharing) served on a sizzling platter...delicious. The steak is served with fries. As sides we had a Mediterranean salad, and roasted veg. For dessert we shared an apple blossom (pie) and a chocolate mousse...both delicious. The prices are extremely reasonable. The wine list by the glass is very limited but that wine is acceptable. There is a full bar and a wine list by the bottle.\nOverall an excellent experience and one we will repeat."

The food was all competently prepared, but not particularly memorable and pricing edges this otherwise average restaurant into finer dining territory. Good value it is not. Not a recommend; there are better oyster bars, better steakhouses, and better pan-Asian restaurants in the city to choose from. Service was friendly, attentive and well timed."

They said they can't afford me. They contacted me to meet them for an interview and made promises that they never kept. They let go most of the original staff including the Head Chef, Assistant General Manager and general Manager. The owner was from Germany and on his visit kept saying I'm doing a great job. Then they gave me notice. Not a good way to treat their staff after we helped setting up the restaurant.  The owner might have a lot of money, but that is not the way to get a good name . I enjoyed working there while it lasted. They just needed staff to help set up the restaurant and after they used us , let most of the staff go. I should never have left my other job. This proof that the grass is not always greener on the other side and never trust what your employer tells you. It is all lies"

I wasn't really enjoying the powdered parmesan on top. I also found the location to be very dark. I understand mood lighting is a thing, but a touch more brightness I feel would be slightly more comfortable. But really not that big of a deal at all.

I was with a large group, and multiple menu items were sold out by our 830 dinner reservation. I was told that the pasta special was a cream base, so when it arrived and it was tomato based I was very disappointed. It was very bland, and pretty tasteless. I was really really disappointed. The server seemed really sorry for how incredibly long things took, and the fact that everything was sold out. I would suggest that management go over what is in the food with their staff, and make sure that things are available when a 14 person reservation is coming... or just stop offering large reservations to avoid disappointment. Patio is so beautiful, so it is too bad that the food was not good."

It was another 30+ minutes until our food arrived.\nUniformly, the food was no more than decent.\nServers were all smile-free, and you'd be hard-pressed to call them \"service-oriented\".\nThe place was certainly not full. So no excuses.\nDo not waste time here..."

Too bad I couldn't say the same thing about the service - took the waitress about 10 minutes after we sat down for her to even notice us and that was after we asked her if we could order something.\n\nAPRIL 2019 - I went back again (the food was delicious) and the service was completely different than my first visit.  Emma, our waitress was very friendly, down to earth and made us feel very welcome. The food was delicious. Had the turkey burger (again), as well as the corn fritters and fried mac and cheese (both apps) and they were fabulous.  I would definitely return, if not for the service, for the food."

I had my wedding after party here - reserved 4 booths - and when I say that Charisse pulled out all the stops - this girl made the evening at STK for our group. She made sure our tables were ready - set up - the high energy - and the sparklers on the drinks - just wow. The music was bomb that evening too! Had everyone dancing. She made sure from the months prior that we were organized and always informed. We had a fairly large party and many of my guests expressed how this was the best wedding after party they had ever attended. Don't think twice about booking your special event - it's got something for everyone and with Charisse, you're in good, capable hands. She'll go over and beyond for her clients. If I could give more than 5* I would."

Paella is hard to get the flavours right and not make it too bland or overly salty and this place did it right, it was perfectly seasoned, meat was moist, seafood was well cooked and I really loved the crispy bits of the rice stuck on the bottom of the pan that you can scrape up. I also really loved their appetizer of bacon wrapped date with honey, I could eat a handful of those and still want more. They've also got some great cheese and meat charcuterie boards and some delicious red sangria. They've also got live entertainment on certain days and all they ask is if each person spends a minimum of $30 which I think is very reasonable for authentic and delicious food and entertainment of Flamenco dancing."

Although I had some good experiences elsewhere, I felt usually let down by something. Embrujo, on the other hand, consistently gets it right; great wine, fabulous sangria, best paella I've ever had, good coffee and fabulous desserts. They have a WONDERFUL life flamenco show (check the hours!). I've been going to Embrujo on special occasions and to celebrate anniversaries for the past 3 years and have NEVER been disappointed and to top it all up...the prices are also quite reasonable!!!"

Staff is always amazing! \n\nThe only reason I didn't leave 5 stars is because I was a little disappointed with my Lobster Roll when I was in last week. The lobster itself was cooked beautifully, I just think if you're going to price it at $48, it shouldn't be 70% bun and 30% lobster meat. I just ended up wanting more meat, with a slightly less-dense bun. I probably wouldn't order it again, but as it's a BBQ-centric restaurant, I should've just ordered the platter like I have every other time before and enjoyed tremendously because they do meat VERY well. Not to say they can't do seafood - my Argentinean shrimp was delicious, as were the oysters, and another person in my party ordered a fish dish and seriously contemplated licking the plate. \n\nAll in all, it's an amazing place to come with a group, or even on a date. Would definitely recommend!"

Ultimately, this is offset by the heavy corporate vibe that emanates from every corner. Not surprised as clearly this restaurant is well situated in the financial district.\n\nThe service was okay, if a bit abrupt. Not overly friendly, or professional as they were just hanging around in a corner when it wasn't so busy. When it was finally time for our waiter to take our order, the responses were short and abrupt. Not very welcoming. Our waiter even forgot our appetizer.\n\nThe food was very good. Albeit, a bit overpriced, but that's the premium you pay for dining where you dine. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the clientele pay via company credit card as opposed to personal funds, which is what allows them to charge more. Oysters were fresh and delicious, and the cashew goat cheese is a must have for any and all cheese lovers.\n\nOverall, the pricing and the service is what brought this place down from a five star. If service was outstanding, I wouldn't mind making this a five star, as the food quality can justify and support the pricing."

The staff are all amazing. \n\nI had dinner with a couple of family members the other night. At first we were seated at a table right across from the kitchen. It was a bit loud. At the same time the restaurant was packed and I was not sure if they could move us. One of the managers, Ester, was absolutely amazing in finding us a cozy corner table and made the world of difference in our experience. She checked on us a few minutes after we moved to our new table. Our server, Maven (I hope I remember her name right) was absolutely phenomenal. The other staff were also fantastic. The food was delicious (I must say I liked the dishes I from my previous visit more). All in all, the service and courtesy they provide at the Chase is exemplary.\n\nThank you to Ester, Maven and the other staff whom I did not get a chance to ask their name."

The place has a cool rooftop as well with enough space in the ground floor to host private events too. The oysters were very fresh and the tuna ceviche added that extra zing next to it.

Planning with Jamie was a breeze, she made everything so simple from the start! Andre is amazing, from the tasting to the day of events, he kept us in the loop and made the night run so smoothly! The chefs who created our menu were wonderful and all of our guests were very pleased. We did Canapés and food stations and it worked out really well! The space itself is incredible, no need for decorations (which was a bonus). Our friends and family have referred to it as “the best wedding they have ever been to!” If you are getting married or just want a nice place to grab a bite, hit this place up! You will not be disappointed! Can’t wait to celebrate our 1 year anniversary here! 💕"

The fish curry was my favourite. The staff seem friendly and patient.\n\nCons: It took forever to get our food (~1 hour), and our server didn't come around often enough (we sat in the patio). A few times through the meal we had to go inside to find a server ourselves.\n\nProbably would just order takeout from here next time."

This location (even though smaller) was no different, and actually service was better here (which is not quite there in the Missiausaga location, though still satisfactory). The food is amazing, with decent quantity per serving. Everything we ordered was great; this was probably first time eating Indian Cuisine for some people in the group, but everyone loved the food. Location is great and ambiance is very cozy. One thing that I would advice the management would be, to renovate/ clean up the approach to washrooms (looked very run down), but washrooms were clean, so no issues there. We were a big group, stayed there for a good amount of time, and were not rushed to order or to pay, which was appreciated. However, this was on a Wednesday, so need to go back during a busy time around weekends to see if the experience remains the same. Will definitely be going back!"

Then five min later I received a message from the Office Pub saying good news, your order will be ready sooner, only 10 min. So I go to pick it up at the designated time and there is only one server running around and only one cook. I waited 10-15 min . before the server even asked my name for the pickup. And when she brought it to me it was the original time (20-25 min) so why bother telling me to pick it up sooner? She then made an excuse that she was the only one there, and there was only one person in the back....how is that my problem? Just don't tell me to come earlier then to sit there and be ignored. This was my first time ordering from The Office Pub with the intention of possibly doing a few office functions there, but given my first experience I think I will pass. I gave it two stars because my chicken pesto wrap and salad was good, so I'll give them that."

Everything from the food, the belly dance performance, the staff, the servers, the manager, everyone was well mannered, very polite and very friendly. The food was so delicious that we definitely over stuffed ourselves :). Little touches like the complimentary Moroccan tea at the end of the meal were very thoughtful. The ambiance was cozy and very welcoming. Definitely going there again, soon!! Well worth the price and very well maintained!!!"

As a vegetarian I typically am limited on the selections and variety of options, and was anticipating that however even with the tasting menu, the chef was able to accommodate. Surprisingly the food was delicious and plated in an aesthetically pleasing manner! I loved everything from the elegance, to the views of the CN tower/lakefront, to the food and the service. Absolutely breathtaking views at sunset! The only downside is that you need to take the stairs and go down a level for the bathroom. Otherwise my evening was perfect. I can’t wait to go back."

Often you'll not be seated as the host is typically missing, it also may take some time before you're greeted or served. Overall it's lacking in customer service, the staff seem unhappy. However the sliders are unique as they're made with thinly sliced slow cooked barbecue roast beef, topped with coleslaw and served on a brioche bun. If you're looking for customer service there are other places close by. This location is however, accesible via the PATH."

I stood up and left... this is a very pretentious place because of how she acted in my opinion and I feel I got that response because I’m black and it didn’t look like I fit in. Didn’t matter that I was in a suit or anything... this is often the experience as a black man in Toronto in these types of places... you’re treated like a second class citizen. The workers here need to be trained to get rid of their biases in my opinion... this wouldn’t have happened if it was an older white or Asian male in a suit... you know what I mean... anyway that’s my two cents on this place.

The $1 Raspberry Point Oysters were delicious, and my friends dishes looked amazing, but a bit pricy for the size. The lone “half priced wine” of the night was a special treat. Delicious & crushable. \nHowever a shallow $17/glass pour of another wine left me thirsty for more after my tasty snack. So we ventured elsewhere for another swirl. I will be back to dive deeper at Ufficio soon. A fun & chic dundas west location with lots of potential, and very likely to impress all those who look for great Toronto dining experiences."

Eating at the restaurant is a whole other experience, at dinner time I ordered their special lamb and prawn dish and I was blown away. The employees are also very well mannered, informative, and always make the best suggestions if you don't know what to get. If you are looking for a quality Italian dine-in experience this is the best place in Toronto! All the recipes are also 100% authentic. Make sure you try Marco's special hot sauce!\n-Shawn L."

Most items on the menu are $20+ and I don’t understand why... Banking off the office crowds it seems. \n\nPleasant staff, which always makes dining out better. Service speed was moderate. Very busy during lunch on weekdays."

We ordered the lamb shoulder, a burger with fries, a scotch egg, a steak with mac and cheese and the fish and chips. We noticed that the food order was taking a while and so did our server, he came over to us to apologize for the wait before we asked him about what was taking so long. We waited about 45-50 minutes for our food which, sad to say, was definitely not worth the wait and the prices we paid for them. The lamb ($55) was on the under seasoned and under salted which was a big let down as this was the dish that held up the rest of the orders. The burger($18) was really salty and each mouthful needed to be followed by a sip if water. The meat of the scotch egg($8 single egg) tasted slightly on the sour side (not because it was seasoned that way). The steak was a little cold even though it came out on a hot plate, it was also served with \"barbecue\" sauce, which was really just ketchup with a little chili powder in it, the mac and cheese was pretty decent though. And lastly, the fish($22) was actually pretty good, crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside, but the fries were way too over salted, and I found myself needing to have a sip of water after every mouthful of them. Had we not already waited an hour, we would have complained to the management, but we were already there for too long and decided it wasnt worth it anymore. The music was also too loud, we had to yell across the table to make sure that we could be heard. Definitely won't be coming back here again."

The room, again like its primary competitor, is dark but absent either the contemporary charm of the larger chain or the intimacy of higher end steak houses. Service though slow and challenged with several errors made was courteous and friendly, and the delays and mistakes were each acknowledged and addressed. The food was unfortunately very average. The crab cakes resembled flattened pucks; the exteriors were breaded and the interiors unfortunately lacked texture and resembled a crab paste. Our friends enjoyed the French onion soup. The steaks were competently prepared, but were not stand out. My rib eye was the thinnest I have ever seen. Though claiming to age in house, flavour was likewise not stand out, and either the steak itself or the accompanying flavoured butters were very, very salty. Had the steaks been priced closer to their competitor's, value for the experience would have been acceptable, but at app. $40 and up per steak Wildfire is simply \"in the wrong weight class\". A great night with friends, but not a repeat destination."
