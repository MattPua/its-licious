I got the pulled pork grilled cheese. I went during lunch time and the service was slow even though it wasn't busy. Food didn't come out at the same time for our group of 10 people which sucked.

She's a health nut and was bit concerned but she found plenty of healthy choices. She had the Caveman salad with salmon. Very fresh! Yet still savory. I had the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich. It was out of this world especially dipped in the cranberry sauce. I made the mistake of sharing with my gf...she ended up eating half and she doesn't even eat sandwiches!  The duck fried sweet potatoes were fabulous appetizer.  2 of us, including 2 glasses of the house....~$100."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107503467583620780555/reviews","rating":2,"time":1514693225,"text":"I have no problem with an expensive menu, but when the prices are high I expect the food quality to be high as well.
