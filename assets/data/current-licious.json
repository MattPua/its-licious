It was my first time there and I loved it. The staff were very friendly and the service was about the best I have experienced. Once seated I took a good look around. Simply beautiful. Clearly a great deal of thought and work went into creating such a wonderful space. As I sat there I began to notice the wonderful aromas of the different dishes which served to tease and excite. It is a great space to sit and enjoy with great friends. I ordered the Chicken Coconut Soup, Cashew Chicken with Rice and for dessert a Chocolate Mousse. The various courses were served to all guests at the same time (something that I feel is important and sadly often lacking in many restaurants these days). We all got to enjoy and share each course together. The food was fantastic. In fact I can say it was the best Thai food I have ever had.  What a pleasant dining experience and night out. What a great find in downtown Toronto. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return again and again."}],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=15520431483707468901","rating":4},"yelpData":{"yelpId":"u2ETlHOcFdRz4BxcdfsK0Q","imageUrl":"https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HqnldJxlUGzsYp5Xyy9QbA/o.jpg","photos":["https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HqnldJxlUGzsYp5Xyy9QbA/o.jpg","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JH3z2ypLB80bRL3pjUwrTw/o.jpg","https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t9NOxoAQi062T6GxLfzEXg/o.jpg"],"rating":3,"reviewCount":124,"yelpUrl":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/bangkok-garden-restaurant-toronto?adjust_creative=PWUs4VuL1ISNEMp6OTuQaQ&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=PWUs4VuL1ISNEMp6OTuQaQ","reviews":[{"id":"5xRo8o2reMVkF0vJkTWUIA","text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner last night and once again was extremely satisfied with the quality of the food, the service, and beautiful venue. \n\nBtw...","url":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/bangkok-garden-restaurant-toronto?hrid=5xRo8o2reMVkF0vJkTWUIA&adjust_creative=PWUs4VuL1ISNEMp6OTuQaQ&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_reviews&utm_source=PWUs4VuL1ISNEMp6OTuQaQ","rating":5,"timeCreated":"2018-01-28 05:43:00"},{"id":"nNIjvWxooYqVApE1R4kH0w","text":"I was here as part of the Elm Wood Spa exotic escape package for two.

Everything was delicious and we were all pleased with our orders.\n\nThe burger that I order was small compared to some other places but it was thick and very juicy. Yes, it can be considered \"pricey\" but considering where you are it's not too bad. The burger was simple but tasty and perhaps one of the top ones I've ever had. It was moist and flavourful with a little pink in the middle... give it a try, you won't regret it.\n\nOur waitress, Madison, was extremely nice and we never felt rushed to leave even though our meal was over and our billed paid. She even gave my mother-in-law a free dessert for her birthday even though she didn't want to order one because she was stuff. It even had Happy Birthday written in chocolate.

I have seen plenty of restaurants having price error on their menu, every single one of them either fixed it by hand or told me when I place my order. \nBtw, their cuban style steak sucks, its well done and has a dreadful taste. \nI will not recommend and will never return."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118445841220488273515/reviews","rating":5,"time":1529941210,"text":"Fantastic Pisco sours and succulent dishes coupled with brilliant service."}],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=11175627531862022435","rating":4.5}},{"lic_address":"17 A Yorkville Ave","lic_lunch":"No","lic_dinnermenu":["Soup of the Day","or","Truffled Beef Carpaccio, Crispy Capers, Parmigiana Crostini, Pickle","or","Burratta, Heirloom Tomato, Cucumber, Basil, Salsa Verde","or","Sous Vide Octopus, Pineapple Salsa, Roasted Eggplant Purée, Harissa Sauce","or","Summer Mix Greens, Shaved Fennel, Ricotta Salata, Balsamic, Citrus Vinaigrette <i>(can be made vegan)</i>","<hr/>","Pistachio Seared Ahi Tuna, Capers, Coleslaw, Pineapple Carpaccio, Salsa Verde","or","Grilled Flatiron Steak, Black Tuscan Kale, Roasted Corn Purée, Red Wine Veal Jus","or","Roasted Atlantic Salmon, Sumac Yogurt, Rapini, Farro Grains, Roasted Eggplant Purée","or","House Made Parpadelle, Italian Sausage, Green Peas Toasted Walnuts, Rapini, Chili Garlic Sauce","or","Baked Panelle, Wild Mushroom, Spinach Tomato Farro Ragu, Salsa Verde <i>(vegan)</i>","<hr/>","Tiramisu","or","Pistachio Cannoli","or","Cherry Ricotta Crostata","or","Sorbet of the Day <i>(vegan)</i>"],"lic_documentID":"8A0D85637B9ACA268525788E00754B7B","lic_dinner":"Yes","lic_twit":"","lic_lunchlink":"","lic_dinnerlink":"http://www.opentable.com/single.aspx?rid=26239&covers=2&dateTime=2018-7-6T19%3a00+PM&ref=2468","lic_local":"No","lic_neighbourhood":["Yorkville"],"lic_youtube":"","lic_numSort":"900","lic_cuisine":["Italian"],"lic_veggie":"No","lic_search_name":"Blu Ristorante","lic_dinnerprice":"$53 Dinner","lic_imagelink":"blu_interior_customers.jpg","lic_fb":"","lic_url":"http://www.bluristorante.com","lic_phone":"416-921-1471","lic_profile":["On the quiet eastern front of Yorkville, set back behind a brick façade, Blu is an Italian restaurant featuring authenticly classic yet contemporary cuisine.

We chose here mainly because it looked somewhat busy and they have a nice-sized patio. I was a bit discouraged seeing the low rating on Yelp, but thought we would give it a try anyways. To begin, the waiter tried to be helpful but couldn't really answer some of our questions about the menu. After we ordered it took at least 30-45 min to get our food, and the food itself was very mediocre and very overpriced. $22 for a simple Cobb salad with sparse ingredients is ridiculous, though the chicken was well-cooked. We also ordered the calamari appetizer which was rubbery and didn't taste fresh. The best part of the meal was the side of fries, as they were crispy and decadent. There was a loud wedding inside the restaurant, and many of the guests were hanging around outside, blocking the doorway that the staff use to bring out food from the kitchen, shouting and swearing. Overall, definitely wouldn't go back. There are much better places in Baldwin Village (Kinton probably being the best, but a better choice when it's cold outside)."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114412656176350286286/reviews","rating":5,"time":1526415038,"text":"Loved this place .

Now the cost is on the expensive side when you go to Chiado, but with the quality of their dishes and knowledge of their chef, you definitely have your money's worth."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117482994403772733874/reviews","rating":5,"time":1519434531,"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious and the staff is extremely accommodating, friendly and knowledgeable!

The service was unbelievable firstly for 18 people we had one waitress which I thought was odd. It would take her 20 minutes to get a drink or a refill. The waitress was also rude towards some of the people who came to celebrate my birthday party. Also some people asked for well done meat as this is a special request and it just did not happen at all so some of my friends had to pay full price for a buffet of salad and mac and cheese. At the end of our dinner a lot of us we're unpleased and just wanted the bill to leave and that took another 25 minutes. So while waiting for the bill I personal asked to speak to the supervisor or manager. So the gentleman came over I explained the situation and he offered to take a couple of drinks of three bills which in my opinion don't think it was enough.

Charlie took care of myself and my girlfriend as if we were family, tended to our needs, and ensured an unforgettable experience. The Dining room is well lit and the ambiance is enjoyable. Furthermore the entertainment experience was actually entertaining and interactive! Guests are encouraged to take pictures with the dancers which personalizes the experience even more. The pineapple dish here is the best thing I have ever tasted and would have missed out on, if not for the recommendation of Charlie.

Yikes."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111078762296318399328/reviews","rating":2,"time":1520121489,"text":"My friend wanted to come here despite being pretty far from us, but I agreed to come with her and my other friend to try the place out. First off, as soon as you enter you'll realize the atmosphere is different. It looks nice, modern, and fancy. You'll also notice that the type of people that eat here are very classy.\n\nNow the first time I looked at the menu, I thought that the prices were to be expected based off the atmosphere. My friends were significantly surprised that they had to pay $10 for 5 dumplings the size of an acorn. I reassured them that it's most likely taste over quantity. We ordered one of each of their dumplings.\n\nThe kobe beef dumplings were disappointing. I guess it was a long shot to expect the beef to taste like the Kobe beef I had when I was in Kobe, Japan, but I expected it to at least taste a little less bland. The skin was delicious though, and I do believe when they say they make them in-house.\n\nThe veg dumplings were overpowered by strong flavours, which overshadowed the delicious texture and taste of the skins. Perhaps if the filling was chopped a little more fine it may solve the imbalance.\n\nThe Veal and ginger dumplings were the better of the three. The flavours were balanced, though had an unusual tartness to them. The skin was still good, and the Ponzu sauce was average.\n\nThe service is a whole different case. The hostess sat us down to order and told us the waitress would arrive shortly to take our order, bringing hot towels and mini appetizers. Then she went to stand by the counter leaning against it, looking bored. We looked through the menu, and the waitress still had not arrived but I had some questions. I waived over the hostess, seeing that nobody else was there, and inquired about the menu. She put on a really bad fake smile (cuz as soon as she was done talking it dropped) and said she was new and knew nothing about the food, telling us to wait for the waitress. She went back to her spot leaning against the counter. Finally the poor waitress arrived at our table flustered but ready to take our order. We asked our questions and she answered to the best of her ability. \n\nAfter eating, I was disappointed(as you can tell by my food review). I wanted to get the bill so we could leave. I waved over the hostess, but she looked at me, then looked away. I said a light 'excuse me', but she still continued to ignore me. Finally, I got fed up and went up to the counter with my own fake smile. As I made my way up, I heard her say to one of the other waitresses that was doing something on the POS system that the veal they served 'was actually bad', but immediately quieted as I approached. I was fearful hearing this, because our table was the only one that ordered dumplings; being the observant type, I had been scanning the small space to see what other people ordered. Did she mean bad as in taste bad, or bad as in the ingredients went bad? I wasn't sure at the time, but I did have an upset stomach later that night.\n\nAt the counter, I tried to ask for the bill but before I could even finish my sentence she cut me off and told me the bill would be brought to my table and I should sit back down. A little aghast at her attitude, I went to sit back down and waited for the bill. \n\nOverall, I was very unhappy with my experience. I'll admit that my party was diverse, and perhaps it was discriminatory values that made our experience different. Despite our outward appearances, we still acted with respect however, so I cannot comprehend why we were treated in such a manner.\n\nI think it is only the service that was sub-par, hence the extra star. If they improved service, I would say, that paired with their food, it would at least put them a little bit higher on the 5-star scale."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111363897531893385969/reviews","rating":5,"time":1512086290,"text":"Fun menu and very friendly atmosphere and price.

Once our table was ready and I approached the other hostess, she looked at my friends stroller, rolled her eyes and mumbled, \"Ugh, a stroller\". She put us at a table for four and my friend and I sat to one side that had other tables close to us. For the rest of the morning, every time Amy had to seat someone, instead of going around the table, she went through the very small space between us and the other tables, bumping my chair each time. The only thing that made the experience better was not our server (he delivered the food and was never seen again until the bill) but another server - she was mature, Filipino with glasses - she was incredibly sweet and friendly and we wish we could have only interacted with her the entire time. We both got standard breakfast meals - eggs, bacon/sausage, toast, fruit but we got the pancakes and waffles as well. The food is decent, but nothing special for breakfast.

I walked into restaurant with only two tables and nobody visible to help me. I sat down and could see some kitchen help that knew I was there, and still waited and waited and waited for somebody to come out.\nWhen somebody finally did come out I was able to order beer and ask for a menu. The girl seemed surprised that I was going to order food and it wasn't that late. It was 8:30 p.m. and there was still two tables in there. But oddly enough I barely saw her all night long. I ordered the steak and the steak was amazing and all of my three stars are because the steak was really good. What was lame was the side of green beans that were barely steamed almost raw. With absolutely no flavor no seasoning whatsoever. And it will serve for fries and the fries were good. I had that lobster crab bisque soup that was interesting but I don't know why it get such high rating cuz I didn't think it was that good. My meal was basically a really good steak and a really good beer. The cost was pretty enormous for how lame everything had been. I felt like the service was really under par and the meal was not thought out. When I was first ordering I was pushed towards a two-course option. And then as I was ordering she asked me if I wanted an appetizer and I had already forgotten that it was included and said I'm fine. Then I realized I think I'm paying for an appetizer and that's when I added the soup. Overall I felt like it was very lame. Comes to the end of the night and the last table in the place and her back is to me for the longest period of Time full day napkins, I don't know what she was doing. All I know is I had to get up and walk over and ask her to bring me out. I was the only person in the place it wasn't that hard.

It was absolutely delicious but the portion side was shocking! It was probably the smallest portion size I've ever seen in my life (and I eat out a lot at restaurants). I still felt really hungry after finishing. In all honesty, I would have expected double the amount they gave me. I would have gave this place 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for the stingy amount of food they served me. It's not like it's cheap either.\n\nMy friend who also ordered the same dish got the same measly amount. I noticed some of the people at our table who ordered meat got a better portion size. I don't know if this it just the standard portions they serve for vegans or what was going on but I was very disappointed by it. Everything else was great though. Good service, nice atmosphere and I'm actually happy they have a Vegan menu.

We finished our pre-dinner event earlier and I sent my guests there to have a few drinks before dinner, they arrived about 45 minutes earlier than the reservation. This was clearly a mistake on my end because it was not well received and stressed out the staff. For the entire night I felt bad about this and apologized to Giancarlo multiple times to try and change his mood. I will say now, I have mixed feelings about even feeling bad. Our group was very easy going and polite. It is a celebratory event and I shouldn't have had to feel bad that we showed up early when my guests were very polite and respectful. They nor I were not all greeted as well as we could have been.\n\nI had a set dinner and there was miscommunication here and I should have gotten things cleared up on my end in writing. Giancarlo was gracious and honoured the price we verbally agreed to. Thank you.\n\nOverall food was good, great atmosphere, and most importantly our guests had a great time. This event was something very special for us and we appreciated the accommodation though I wish the service was a little bit friendlier.

The beef looked equally as amazing and the popover on other guests plates made the dish look even more appealing. Where I became upset is that our beef dishes came to our table without the popover. I would of settled for the risotto if we were made aware that no popover was included.

I take my health seriously, and it is your responsibility as a restaurant to make sure your patrons are in a healthy environment as well. \n\nAs customers that have been eating at your restaurant for 8 years, we will never be coming back. \n\nI hope this issue is addressed because that sort of lackadaisical service is how someone can get hurt."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112596651865082082094/reviews","rating":4,"time":1528507655,"text":"Nice brunch menu.

Beautiful spot, great patio, food and wine list were average. We had a lovely evening with friends until the end when we were overcharged on our bill for items we did not order  then it took the management over a half hour to attempt to resolve. We said we had to leave as we were meeting friends and only then did our correct bill emerge without any real apology other than a business card from the manager saying to call directly to make a reservation at any time.  Not exactly a stellar example of good customer service. Difficult to use the offered compensation gesture when we will never be returning considering  how this situation was handled.

We have been several times in the past, and always enjoyed it.  Great room. Lovely presentation.  But - as other reviews confirm - it appears there has been a change of direction at the Toronto site and it is not for the better.  In short, it was awful. Service was slow to nonexistent.  We watched 3 waiters cash out for 20 minutes at the bar standing next to cocktails long since ordered for our table.  At one point, we were actually bussing the table to remove dishes. Empty plates, glasses and wine bottles went unanswered.  Then the main courses arrived, where 5 of us, after the first bite, paused and stopped, wondering if it was just me? Or could something be this bad.  Then the awkward moment when someone speaks out loud what we were all thinking.... 5 of the 8 mains were insanely salted.  Steaks were over cooked.  First time in my life I've had a plate that was literally uneatable.  The manager somehow walked off while in mid discussion about the issue.  Four of us ordered something else, which - incredibly - was just as over salted and cold.   It was pure comedy.  They still managed to stick us with $1000 + tab, while the stooge manager did nothing, eager to close.  Aside of all this, like other reviews have said, it seemed the portions were small, plating was indifferent, execution was lazy and prices, even for Toronto, excessive.  We've call the GM and outlined this nonsense.... we will keep you posted on the results."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105231247398720550126/reviews","rating":5,"time":1528915623,"text":"Absolutely loved this place!

I came here with a few girlfriends, where half of us did the Chef’s tasting menu and the other half ordered off the dinner menu. Those who ordered off the dinner menu waited about 2.5 hours for their food, while the chef’s tasting menu took almost 4 hours!! No customer should be made to wait that long for food, they were very unorganized with bringing out food for the two different menus at the same table (they told us after that they won’t mix menus at the same table again but that was irrelevant for our experience). Next, after waiting 2.5 hours for a dinner menu item, the pork came out almost raw in the middle - the manager came over to reassure my friend that he had it the other night and it was fine like that, didn’t even take a closer look as to how raw it was (maybe that’s why the lighting is so dim so you can’t see??), so we sent it back and the chef agreed it shouldn’t have been served that raw. Next, when we spoke to the manager about how long the food took to come out that those waiting 2.5 hours lost their appetite, he apologized and said that dessert is on them... they just said they weren’t even hungry anymore?! Lastly, two of us who did the chef’s tasting menu got sick. Never coming back here again!! \n\nI will note that our server was an absolute gem.

Unfortunately, my experience at Luckee was definitely of the former; overpriced and completely average.\n \nI and two others had the Dim Sum for four, which added to about $210 all in with tax and tip. With three people eating the portion size for four, we were still hungry at the end of the meal. While not objectively bad, the dim sum was completely average; in fact, I would argue that there are numerous places in Chinatown that have better dim sum. The fried rice was dry and lacked any real flavor. The offerings might be a creative take on traditional Chinese dim sum, but the dishes just don’t taste GOOD.\n \nFor the price, I feel like you’re paying more for the service and the environment as opposed to the food. Service is top-notch and very attentive, and the atmosphere is fancy without making you feel stuffy. However, it won’t make it for the thoroughly disappoint food. Maybe I, as a Chinese person growing up on my dad’s cooking (and the local family-run restaurant), just don’t understand the uniqueness of the dishes.

Marigold Indian Bistro was consistently mentioned as quite the spot, so off I went on foot from my hotel.  The neighborhood where this place is located is lively and energetic, with many shops, bars and restaurants open late.  The decor of this place was understated, tasteful and relaxed. As the host seated me I overheard the manager/bartender chatting with customers at the bar about different drinks and in particular, a new drink he offered them gratis.  My meal was scrumptious and delicious: hot and tasty.  With each bite I had to close my eyes to experience the full flavor spectrum which was wonderful.  My waiter was quick, friendly and observant though not overbearing.  As I finished, the manager/bar tender began chatting me up and offered me the same new drink he offered the patrons before me.  Not an alcohol drinker, I demurred, though quite happy for the offer.  This place is a combination of wonderful people, great service and fantastic food at great prices.  I give it my highest recommendation."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105941175693278897737/reviews","rating":3,"time":1529776379,"text":"The food is quite good.

At first it seemed to be okay but soon it became obvious that their operation is extremely unorganized, super unprofessional and ridiculous. They do not know how to run a proper, operating restaurant. On top of the (extreme) lack of management skills, the other servers, bartenders, cooks, and staff are hired illegally without Canadian work permits or visas. The chef/owner paid these people in cash instead. I was the only staff member at the time who was eligible to work there legally along with my certificates as a server, which no one else had, and they also weren't required or encouraged to have by \"management\". The chef/owner keeps NO paper trail of his employees. I called to try and get my T4, Record of Employment, etc. but of course, he denied that he knows who I am, that I worked there, etc. Overall, this restaurant did not have the management to run a business...

Good selection of in house beer, tart of darkness is a great dark sour. We came on a Sunday afternoon just after 4 and were told they only had a limited menu.

We had to ask several times for side plates, napkins, and cutlery. Apparently after 4 is buck a shuck but when we ordered oysters we weren't told, it was a nice surprise but it seems like the sort of thing that they would inform us of. When our order was taken the waitress again didn't seem to have a clue as we had to repeat our order several times before she got it right, or so we thought. Our food arrived and was wrong, which is rather difficult as there was a choice of three items on the menu. When we informed that it was wrong they brought the order back and it was again wrong. To their credit the item was removed from our bill. When we asked for our bill it brought and we were ignored for about 15 minutes as we waited to pay.

It was fairly busy, with lineup out the door. Since I was alone, I was able to grab a seat right away at the bar. Yay! I ordered a smoked salmon egg Benedict croissant, and server said it will be ready in 20 minutes due to the high volume of customers. I didn't mind and ordered a mango peach mimosa while I waited. Mimosa was only $5 a glass!! It was a good price and I couldn't say no to that. As soon as I finished my mimosa, an older lady plopped down beside me. She was definitely a regular customer, and you can tell by all the hugs  and kisses she was giving to all the employees that worked there. By the time, I ordered a second mimosa, the lady beside me already got her quiche and salad?!!! I certainly felt neglected and had to inquire the server why my food was taking so long. When my food did arrive, I had to get it packed to go since I was running late for my massage. I was hoping to enjoy my brunch in the restaurant, but unfortunately that didn't happen. This experience did not make me feel like a valued customer, simply because I wasn't a regular customer.

I asked for a bottle of sparkling water and waited 10 minutes for it to arrive.  I thought it was a bit flat but when I spoke to the waiter, he said that this type of water was not as fizzy as Perrier and I could have soda water instead.  That seemed reasonable but then it took another 10 minutes to get soda water.  I ordered a salad with chicken and the chicken was  RAW.  I took a bit and it was cold so I cut another piece and it was raw inside.  I sent it back and then told them to cancel the order as my husband was going to be done eating by the time the new meal arrived and also because I was a little turned off by the RAW chicken.  At some point, the manager came out and apologized and said she would comp the meal.  I thought this meant the whole meal since all I had was flat, sparkling water and a glass of soda but instead, we got the bill for our appetizer and my husband's salad.  I thought the waiter made a mistake so after my husband paid, I asked the manager for clarification, did she really only mean to comp my water?  Her reply was yes, she was comping my \"meal\".  I told her I was disappointed in the whole experience and she said she would take very good care of me next time.  I am not sure there will be a next time.  I understand that kitchens make mistakes, that servers can be slow, but the manager should have handled it better in my opinion.

The pancakes had a really nice blueberry cream & maple cream cheese sauce on it, but I thought they didn't have enough for all of the 3 pancakes. I also only ate one and a half pancakes, since they are pretty dense and filling. I was hoping for a lighter, fluffier pancake. Overall, pretty good!

The service was on average overall, except the server knew it was my birthday (he said happy birthday after we paid) and other tables around got a special birthday treat from STK - NOT ME. We paid as much or more than the other table, but we had nothing. Can your restaurant treat people fairly? A reservation is special for someone at that day, but just to see others be very happy about their special treatment, BECAUSE YOU DO NOT DESERVE IT? The menu has nothing special and the price is clear over-rated.

It's a nice looking venue with a really fun atmosphere but the service isn't great. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation (which was not at peak hours) and still waited 45 minutes. I read other reviews here about them comping some people to make up for it - but not us. We were finally seated and our server didn't know anything about the menu, drinks, or prices. So she just went back and forth asking her colleagues.\n\nAfter many trips back and forth to find that they didn't have the bottle we wanted and to get answers, we were able to order and then wait another 45 minutes until our food actually arrived. Thankfully it was very well done but by that time we would have eaten anything because we were starving.\n\nEverything is wildly overpriced and management knows they have a trendy venue so they really don't care about making things right. There'll be plenty of other people to spend huge amounts of money there if you're unhappy. The venue itself is nice and the food is good (more stars to the chefs) but everything else is garbage and way overpriced. Either way, there are nicer venues and better quality steak houses near by so there's really no point to coming here."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103159865587031506130/reviews","rating":5,"time":1524355575,"text":"My experience was amazing!

The stuffed peppers with goat cheese was scrumptious. Mushrooms, steak on top of a bed of crispy fries and olives topped everything off beautifully. \n\nThe only downside to the visit was a very noisy table in the corner who clearly didn't understand that this was a specialized venue with an incredible Flamenco show, not to be missed.

The upstairs is a classy quiet fine dining restaurant. That's where people are referring to with the surf and turf and the other heavier foods. The downstairs is basically an upscale lounge with almost entirely seafood on their menu. \n\nWe had meant to go upstairs but since we didnt know we ended up booking downstairs. The reservation asks if you're celebrating something you might as well put you're getting married there cause no-one is reading it. Also they do NOT honor their reservations. We had reservations at 8, and were told to wait maybe 30 minutes or longer by the bar. Then i saw there are at least 2 other couples with the same instructions for an 8pm table. So basically they don't care. Then i saw a couple walk in and say they have no reservations and they were also told to wait 30 minutes!!! Unbelievable. \n\nNeither the food nor the service is comparable to restaurants of the same price range. It's a nice atmosphere but that's not so difficult to find in Toronto these days.

Unfortunately, my first impression quickly soured as my guest and I sat and waited for what felt like an eternity before getting any service of any kind. There were only 5 other tables seated in total, and 2 waiters. And considering how small the outdoor area was, it was pretty shocking. When a waiter finally came to our table, not even a \"hi, how are you?\" Or acknowledging our long wait time. \nHe simply said, \"did you decide?\" \n\nThat pretty much ruined what could have been an enjoyable relaxing evening. As for the cocktails, the beezy tasted like mouthwash, although my partner's drink was fine. the calamari was very tasty although the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste. \n\nOverall, atmosphere and outdoor seating is a plus, service was awful, drinks were hit and miss. 1/5 would not recommend to others."},{"authorUrl":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107770201358699020586/reviews","rating":1,"time":1529548563,"text":"My husband and I were passing by the restaurant and thought it was beautiful so we decided to get inside.
