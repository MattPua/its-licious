Aria is owned by Guido Saldini and Elena Morelli the proprietors of Noce Restaurant which has helped set the standard for Italian cuisine in Toronto for almost 20 years.  \"Aria\" means \"air\" in Italian but also references the most Italian of art forms - opera.  Both themes are evident inside Aria which boasts a dramatic 35 foot ceiling and is situated adjacent to the Air Canada Centre and Maple Leaf Square. Aria has dining capacity for 130 people and can accommodate private parties in a variety of formats."],"lic_new":"No","lic_lng":"-79.3812138904","lic_hotel":"","lic_restName":"Aria Ristorante","lic_postal":"M5J 2V5","lic_vegan":"No","lic_lunchprice":"$33 Lunch","lic_mobilelink":"http://m.opentable.com/restaurant/referral?rid=53830&ref=8956&SearchDateTime=2013-06-1T12:00:00","lic_instagram":"http://instagram.com/ariaristoranteto","lic_accessible":"Yes","lic_lat":"43.6434315776","lic_lunchmenu":["BABY KALE SALAD  <i>(local)</i>","apple, cranberry, chickpeas, pumpkin seeds, creamy cashew dressing","or","ZUPPA DI CECI","cod water soaked chickpeas, fresh rosemary, baccal√† salad","or","FEGATINI DI POLLO  <i>(local)</i>","chicken livers, egg, house made bread crostini","<hr/>","STEELEHEAD TROUT  <i>(local)</i>","wilted winter greens, roasted parsnip, tarragon basil butter ","or","BRAISED BEEF CHEEKS  <i>(local)</i>","celeriac pur√©e, black truffle ","or","TAGLIATELLE DI CASTAGNE  <i>(local)</i>","house made chestnut flour tagliatelle, sausage crumble, crispy brussels sprout leaves, toasted black walnuts, butter, sage","<hr/>","MATTONELLA DI MASCARPONE","tea biscuits, coffee, crema di mascarpone","or","TORTINO AL CIOCCOLATO","pears, maple glazed pecans, gelato allo zenzero","or","TARTINA ALLE MELE","apple tartlette, vin cotto, fig gelato"],"lic_additionaladdress":"","yelpData":{"yelpId":"aria-ristorante-toronto","imageUrl":"https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5JP8gmTIF7pS2fBUQUbIJQ/o.jpg","photos":["https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5JP8gmTIF7pS2fBUQUbIJQ/o.jpg","https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tTM6B89Hd1kbQ1TTFoKK4w/o.jpg","https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1Hds-KvRzEhSWPoru-MfDg/o.jpg"],"rating":3,"reviewCount":69,"yelpUrl":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-ristorante-toronto?adjust_creative=PWUs4VuL1ISNEMp6OTuQaQ&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_lookup&utm_source=PWUs4VuL1ISNEMp6OTuQaQ","reviews":[{"id":"mWaMJ2QFQ4Xwf7Xsy9-Q4A","text":"Decent Italian eats steps from the ACC.

Dishes are true to their respective origins and live happily together on a single menu, representing the city‚Äôs motto: ‚ÄòDiversity our Strength‚Äô. Chef/Partner Dustin Gallagher, recently of Top Chef Canada All-Stars, helms the kitchen with a menu driven by ‚Äòcrunch-to-squish ratio‚Äô, fun-to-eat, punchy-flavoured, technique-driven dishes. The bar program by managing partner, Matt See, includes carefully chosen beer, wine and cocktail lists which round out Peoples Eatery‚Äôs offerings.
