He helped us choose a fantastic Portuguese wine based on our taste and we had a good laugh when the cork didn’t want to come out. We ordered the two specials, seafood stew and octopus which where both large portions and really well prepared. Highly recommend this place for seafood lovers."

Every single thing about this restaurant was amazing! From the moment we walked in, to our service, to our food, etc. The ambiance is very romantic or is a perfect place to have dinner with very close friends. With the two bottles of wine, the food and the tip, our bill came up to $300 and change for the four of us. Every dollar was worth it! Thank you so much to the chef and the servers for making this a very special birthday for our friend."

My sister liked her pasta w Vodka sauce.\nThe band played good songs but the 2 singers were awful. It sounded more like screaming than singing. Couldn't hit the high notes. The rest of the band however were pretty good. My advice to them: replace your vocalists. \nThe saving grace was the DJ who played music during the band's break. He was fantastic. Had the crowd going w different music mixes. Played something for everyone."

Overall, the night was awesome. \nThe Service: Fantastic.  I regret not remembering our servers name, but she was great.  She kept the laughs coming along with everything else.  It seemed that everyone working that night was having fun. \nThe Food and Drinks:  Interesting and exciting options.   I started with the barrel aged cocktail and duck heart yakitori, both of which were delicious.   For my main,  I had the Deer, which was prepared Rare Plus, just the way I like my lean red meats.  The spice ash was complex and complimented the gaminess of meat.  Dessert included the Cedar Sour and sticky toffee pudding.  Again, both were fantastic.  My friends got the smoked chocolate dessert, which I have to admit was a bit of a let down.  The presentation was great, but the smoke overtook all other flavours in the dish.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this place."

You get some classic options on the menu that should satisfy most people.  The service was incredible and made us feel very welcome to just hang out and have drinks after our meal was done. One nice little twist on a classic was the Caesar. It was made with sake. Crazy and very good!  I definitely look forward to my next visit here."

When we got to Archeo after our wedding ceremony, we were so happy with the way the venue looked! The venue is already so beautiful so we only needed flowers and candles. The room is perfect for a candlelit dinner. The food was fantastic! We received so many compliments from our guests about how wonderful the food was. The vegetarians were also very happy with the curry! Everything came out very hot and the timing was perfect. The manager greeted us at the door when we came in and made sure we were well taken care of. The room is perfect for 100 people without being too tight. The bartender was also really great! I would highly recommend this venue!"

They served Thai coconut curry with rice which was okay but the butternut squash soup was amazing and rich in texture. Salad had too much of vinegar in that which made it quite sour. Dessert was great. Overall it’s a good place to visit specially during Christmas festivities and the four course meal was very fulfilling."

I was extremely happy with the wedding coordination. We had Chantal as our Coordinator and she was amazing.\n\nThe main reason we chose Archeo as our wedding venue was the interior decor. There was no need to add our own decoration so we only added centrepieces, and photographs as our table runners. Archeo was already gorgeous so we were lucky we didn't need to add more.\n\nOur wedding was during the day so we used the Brunch menu with the added food station that had Asian food. Our guests loved the variety and it was very delicious. They all went home with full bellies.\n\nOverall I'm so glad we chose Archeo as our wedding venue."

I tried tirelessly to convince the banquet manager be he would not budge on having the doors open with the AC on.  it was actually very cool outside I felt that since we paid 20k to have the place for the evening that we could at least make a decision on what we wanted for doors being open and AC on at the same time.  We had a lot of people complain that it was far too hot.  Other than that the venue, servers, bar staff and food was amazing.  I would just recommend talking to the staff beforehand and negotiation having control over the doors being open while the AC is on."

Basically flour and the black pepper is all you will taste if you choose the spaghetti pasta or gnocchi, or anything else on their menu. The risotto is completely average and not worth the $25-$30. The 'Spaghetti Pasta' was bland and a friend asked to return it, and the waitress, 'Nadja', said \"I offered you 3 other options\" and was extremely argumentative and rude about it all. The \"manager\" Martina, was not any more professional and proceeded to defend the rudeness of her waitress staff. It took them well over an hour for them to clear our table and offer the bill. Overall, the food was terrible, bland, and overpriced for tasteless food, and the staff was extremely rude. If you want overpriced tasteless food and pretentious service please come here. Enjoy."

Food is definitely worth the price paid. We dined at the private room...originally we were placed in the center of the main dining area, because when we made the booking, the private rooms were supposedly not available (it seems that the room is available but reservations did not call us back to inform) - this meant we had to wait (only about) five minutes for them to set up the whole private dining room area for a seating of 10 people. Very impressive speed and service. Also, all staff were able to explain the dishes, which is a very rare thing nowadays (come on, there are servers in this world that still don't know what soup of the day is)."

However, the last visit was awful and we had one of the worst experience in the level of service for our wedding anniversary.\n\nThe waiter simply never even bothered to fill our waters, check in on the food, completely ignored us. Even at the very end, when we tried to pay, the server took a good 30 minutes just going back-and-forth for the bill and bringing the credit card machine. It was a weeknight and the restaurant was not busy at all, there were only maybe 2-3 other tables.\n\nLet's just say, we will never return to this restaurant again. For a restaurant of this price range, the level of service was simply, pathetic."

The service was also on point.  My partner and I arrived at the restaurant an hour early and wanted to have a stroll down the street but didn't want to lug our stuff our with us.  The restaurant staff were gracious enough to allow us to put our stuff in the back and pick it up after dinner."

The staff were very friendly and the service was about the best I have experienced. Once seated I took a good look around. Simply beautiful. Clearly a great deal of thought and work went into creating such a wonderful space. As I sat there I began to notice the wonderful aromas of the different dishes which served to tease and excite. It is a great space to sit and enjoy with great friends. I ordered the Chicken Coconut Soup, Cashew Chicken with Rice and for dessert a Chocolate Mousse. The various courses were served to all guests at the same time (something that I feel is important and sadly often lacking in many restaurants these days). We all got to enjoy and share each course together. The food was fantastic. In fact I can say it was the best Thai food I have ever had.  What a pleasant dining experience and night out. What a great find in downtown Toronto. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return again and again."

I requested for it to be replaced and chef added more coconut milk to it to balance and when it arrived back, it tasted like milk and not curry. I was so disappointed. I requested them to make it again and not just add mil to balance, I was told that it will come out again the same way, high salt because of the proportions they use. Wow....finally I had to change my order to spicy fish which was average and by that time I had lost my appetite. Overall a sad evening. You come to a good place for food and all you get is disappointment on a Friday night. I will not go back again. Sonia"

We had made a reservation for 6 and arrived on time but it took another 10-15 minutes for them to have the table ready for us.  We were kept warm and toasty by the roar of the kitchen heat that was streaming from the open kitchen.\n\nI started with the Throwback Thursday drink specials of the night and the Manhattan hit the spot.  The O&B cream of mushroom soup was warming and tasty.  Moved onto my entree of the wood-fired oven pizza special of the day. It was done just fine and the pizza crust was thin and crispy.\n\nOur server was really nice and chatted us up during the meal.\n\nI think you can have a good time here although my expectations and experience of the place don’t really match with the menu prices."

On to the food: Caesar salad - good- healthy, mostly kale, and dressing-free: be careful if want you want is the usual gunky resto version.  Arctic Char- a disappointment.  I didn't particularly care for the fish - seemed a little 'fishy' and otherwise flavourless, and I was turned off by the very, VERY, earthy-flavoured beets.  These are the beets of my youth and I still hate that taste, though in counterpoint my sister said she really liked them.  The broth it all lay in seemed flavourless and just made me ask, 'why?'. Mushroom shepherd's pie - this pie seemed to be entirely made of whipped potatoes, with the mushroom being the crust (?), or lost in the potato, or entirely absent. Anyway, not good.  The winner by all acclaim was the pork chop, very tastily-breaded and large, with decent scalloped potato and mushrooms."

Was seated by one person, another brought us water and both claimed they would be taking care of us, confusing as to who to place an order with. (no alcohol menu online either) Beers were brought to the table without pint glasses (had to go to the bar and ask for some) Staff was attentive at first but went downhill from there. The male server seemed more concerned about sitting at the bar and playing with his phone. After finally getting his attention and wanting to order our meals, we were told they were now on the late night menu. Luckily tacos were part of the late night menu. We were ten told they were closing at ten when website says open late, I hardly think 10pm on a Thursday is late. Food was about the only bright spot, although they had to double check our order to make sure. Once and never again."

Downstairs was dim and looking a little messy, maybe from a busy Friday night. Bathrooms were clean and well maintained. Food and drinks were well overpriced for what they were, my salad had a generous thick spread of yogurt on the bottom with beats, nuts mixed lettuces for $16, I added salmon for $6 (chicken was$8) I had a Caesar $10, it was pretty bland and came garnished with a lime and lemon wedge, even the salt on the rim was lackluster, I don't need a bean or a pickle but can a brother get a celery stalk? Service was excellent, always keeping our water full even after our meal when we chatted for a bit. I don't think I'll be back to eat but they do have table tennis downstairs so there's always a chance"

They always asked if anything was needed and had a warm smile on their faces.\n\nMy wife order the burger as did I while my mother-in-law ordered the roasted beet appetizer and baby spinach salad. Everything was delicious and we were all pleased with our orders.\n\nThe burger that I order was small compared to some other places but it was thick and very juicy. Yes, it can be considered \"pricey\" but considering where you are it's not too bad. The burger was simple but tasty and perhaps one of the top ones I've ever had. It was moist and flavourful with a little pink in the middle... give it a try, you won't regret it.\n\nOur waitress, Madison, was extremely nice and we never felt rushed to leave even though our meal was over and our billed paid. She even gave my mother-in-law a free dessert for her birthday even though she didn't want to order one because she was stuff. It even had Happy Birthday written in chocolate. Seriously, Madison was awesome. Thanks for a great night!"

Be prepared to share the \"table\" with strangers if your party is not large enough to fill the \"table\" - the willingness of the other guests to be engaged with the chef can influence how entertained you'll be.  Food quality was good and quantity was ample but, unfortunately, not unique.  What does set this place apart is it's ambience and the service."

Although it's a little bit expensive for students, but once in a while doesn't hurt much and it's totally worth it! The atmosphere is great, the chef makes great effort to entertain customers while cooking the food in front of everyone. It's a very unique experience to have in Toronto! Also if you go on your birthday/anniversary, the restaurant will prepare a free dessert (either chocolate cake or cheese cake) for you, very good service! I had their cheese cake, I'd say I made the right choice! Will come back for sure! 👍🏼"

Corkage if you bring your own wine I believe is about $25.\n\nWe started with the smelts which were hot and crispy with lashings of mayonnaise. The Caesar salad is cool with an easy dressing. The bread-and-butter on the side is just too tempting.\nOur main dishes were the lamb with noodles, the noodles are almost irrelevant the lamb is wonderful and melt in the mouth. The Cornish hen was plentiful and very crispy – we had french fries to accompany it which were excellent."

We couldn't move after the meal. We got a huge assortment of meats and dishes. The rotating taps were pretty good as well. I loved the gourmet backyard bbq style of the food and even the decor. We loved the fact that they played classic rock too, totally fit the vibe. Only recommendation would be to dress warm; the heaters weren't strong enough to heat the entire place. Great place, highly recommended!"

The place itself is behind Rose and Sons and is supposed to feel like a cabin. Its a wonderful concept, just a tad chilly in -20 degree weather. There were space heaters and blankets and it really wasnt that bad. The smoked meat dishes were to die for. Its best to go in medium sized groups as all the plates are meant to share and it can get pretty pricey as a twosome."

She was prompt in responding to emails and outlined all costs in detail. When we arrived, Desiree and Vanessa, set up our Projector (I had no idea what I was doing) and stuck around to help hand out Welcome Cocktails (Kentucky Mule) to the attendees and ensure everything was in order. Desiree checked in to make sure everything was to our satisfaction before her night ended and left us in the competent hands of her servers. Staff were friendly and attentive throughout. This place knocked the food out of the park! I wish I took pictures. The staff raved about everything from the ribs to the cornbread and to my surprise, continued to order the Kentucky Mules well into the evening. I highly recommend this establishment, especially for large groups. This team runs like a well oiled machine. You will not be disappointed!"

The menu is very simple and offers some good options for brunch/lunch. If you have a big party or if you have kids, this is also a good restaurant to consider. Especially when you want more space, this venue can offer you a lot of space for your party. \n\nA good selection of brunch items that can considered if you like waffles. They have chicken and waffle or braised pork and waffles. They also have sandwiches and burgers if you are feeling a heavier meal. \n\nI ordered the big breakfast. Their big breakfast comes with sausage, roasted potatoes, 3 eggs (any style), some roasts and salad. It’s a decent meal for $15. I came out satisfied with their brunch but I wouldn’t go here if you’re looking for something unique for brunch. It’s just a good gathering place for your friends and family for lunch/brunch though!\n\nLAST TIP??\n\nIf you check in with yelp, you’ll get a free prosecco offer. Kind of early for a champagne but hey, it’s free!"

We had a show to get to and had to ask every other server working for our bill and the machine as our server was busy talking to people at the bar and not serving his tables.

However service is pretty awful the last couple of times we have been there, so will not be frequenting Bymark in the future. My company also used to order food for lunch, but last order food seemed rushed and fries were soggy and seemed to have been from hours ago. Comparing to how food used to be from this place, it has gone downhill and definitely not worth the high-end price."

We loved the quiet atmosphere, elegant, slow but great service, and meals that were finally a notch above the rest. This is a restaurant we have now tried twice, and loved every dish we have been served. And we are hard to please! PS. the first night we went, the waiter was not great, but food was so good, we tried it again. Had a great waitress, and an overall terrific night. We will return again!"

They struggled to get my steak just right, came out a little too well done around the outside and I unfortunately had to send it back and wait for another one. It took a little while, but they made sure I wasn't hungry and gave me a plate of food - for free, mind you - whilst I waited. When we had finished our meal, and the bill came, they did not charge me and apologized profusely for the steak. Didn't NOT want to pay - as the food was delicious! - so offered to tip instead. Will definitely be returning, with many people on many more occasions and recommending this to everyone I can. The staff was so, so lovely! Vibe is amazing, too. Only negative is the wait time but honestly, it was worth waiting an hour and half for the customer service and quality of food."

The music is better than that at any bar I've been to (doesn't suit the theme of the restaurant though) and the movie reel playing in the background was very tasteful (Bruce lee's game of death). \nThe drinks are very pricey considering that 90% of it was just ice but the wine selection was adequate. \nThe duck confit was nothing special but the braised lentils were definitely good enough for me to revisit the dish. \nWaitresses and staff were also super friendly. Overall, I'd recommend this place for a date, certainly a place you need to try at least once."

However, this would have been a 5 star review if the music was slightly quieter, I felt I had lost my voice the next day trying to yell to be heard. I also found the servings weren't that filling, even with amount we ordered. I'm a petite person and found even I wanted at least another side, but for the price we paid no one should have felt wanting more. The thing that left everything on a slightly sour note was when it came to ordering dessert. We were celebrating a birthday and not only did we order ALOT of food but we each also ordered dessert, and most places I've been the birthday persons dessert is on the house, but even if it wasn't I wouldn't be too bothered (hey every place is different). However our waitress on MULTIPLE occasions kept saying 'that dessert isn't free, we have a complimentary birthday dessert which is a small chocolate treat of some kind (I've attached a picture)' which we said was fine but we also wanted the desserts regardless if they're complimentary or not. To which she kept saying 'but we won't be paying for that.' Perhaps there have been issues before with people assuming the desserts would be free, but after we've agreed, you need to take our order and just give us the food. Instead it was a 10 minute back and forth on explaining we just want to satisfy our sweet tooth regardless of the cost. The food was definitely 5 stars, atmosphere and staff could use some work, and maybe a smidge more of the sides."

This was right after our server asking if we wanted another drink. Why ask for last call if you are going to kick people out right after.\nDefinitely do not recommend or coming back ever.

Greeting us by our reservation name was a lovely touch!\n\nHowever, service was rushed and drinks were very poor. \n\nWe all work hard for our money and at 15$ per glass, I feel anyone is deserving of a well chilled, properly presented beverage from all means and walks of life. My drink was served in the wrong glass - not necessarily a big deal, but then it was simply poured into another glass with the ice removed rather than a chilled glass. These days, if you're a mixologist and charge me like I owe you child support, I figured to expect some knowledge and care. Also, I saw film floating  around in the drink due to the warmth of the beverage. It was simply a bit gross. At that point I didn't say anything because I was already disheartened and felt as an inconvenience to the staff. \n\nOur server seemed rushed and spent no time to ask us about the drink after asking for it to be changed - not really throughout our meal, now that I think about it, either.\n\nPickup staff, those who delivered our food or brought garnishes and sides, were absolutely fantastic and friendly!\n\nUnfortunately, would not visit again."

Also, before drinking your coffee make sure to check if there's no lipstick mark on the edge of your cup because they don't wash it properly.\nThe waiters seem to not even bother with the bad service anymore .. if you complain about something they ironically apologize.

We thought the food a really excellent mixture of finesse and down-to-earth Canadian eating. Something that came out very well in each dish and the combined tastes. We recommend the mushroom soup (with a strong taste of truffles) and the heritage pork, rounded of with a Niagra peninsula Riesling.\nContrary to some of the more negative reviews here, our courses arrived very quickly (although the restaurant was full) and were certainly not too small."

        "text": "Atmosphere, food, service and view are all amazing.\n\nThis post is more tips for people that want to try canoe and not blow their budget and have an amazing experience.\n\nTip #1 make a reservation and pick a good time. This restaurant is busy, don't expect to get a window table for 4 at 6 pm on Friday night.  Find a time when the restaurant is more calm.\n\nTip #2 skip dinner go for lunch. It is almost the same menu and the prices are $15-20 less a plate.  The view is better during the day. My girlfriend and I went at 1:15 on a Thursday and got a window seat no problem.  The business crowd is just leaving at the time and from 1-230 it's get nice and quiet.\n\nTip #3: look for pictures and speak to your waiter about dishes and what you are looking for. We shared a large steak tartare for an appetizer. My gf had beef strips and I had Arctic char for main, we both tried each other's dishes and split a dessert and we were stuffed. \n\nTip #4: wine and alcohol can be expensive. So if you are really looking to save skip the wine. If you still want to have a glass each order 9 ounce of wine, it will be about $27 and u can split that and each have a good size glass.\n\nTip #5: this is a true dining experience. Take your time, enjoy it. Don't be a critique while you are eating. Go in with an open mind and enjoy.\n\nHope this helped!"

Usually go when it isn't busy or with reservations, so don't have much experience with wait times. \n\nService is normally quite good with friendly staff willing to crack a joke or two. wait times for food aren't unreasonable, never waited over half an hour even for a large, medium well steak\n\nFood itself is good quality, prices are 20-40 bucks for most meals. Steaks are probably a tad overpriced, but they at least have good flavour options compared to many other places. Not too good for the gluten sensitive though, most of their sauces contain some amount."

My waiter, I think his name was Jeff, was very knowledgeable of the menu and his recommendations were spot on. I had the pot roast (12oz aged 40 days) with a loaded baked potato on the side. I'm a pretty big guy in this completely filled me up, very good portion sizes. The cream of mushroom soup that I had as an appetizer was also delicious, I'd recommend that as well. For dessert I had the seasonal creme brulee which was very good. I personally hope to come back here, and I suggest you would as well."

        "text": "I got the steak from the fixed price menu (10oz New York strip). Came with choice of Salad or French Onion Soup and a dessert of Cheesecake or Creme Brulee. The french onion soup was average at best and I got tired of it half way through. The steak seemed like it was pan fried in vegetable oil and over salted. It was not appetising at all and I left a good portion of it on my plate. I got a baked potato as a side and again, just average. The cheesecake was good though and the only thing I finished. The service was pretty awful which was surprising considering the fact that the place was almost empty with the exception of 1 other table of 2 (we were a table of 6). The waiter forgot about drink orders and was generally not checking in. Finally, we got separate bills and only 1 of us paid with cash but yet somehow the restaurant wasn't able to give any change for $100 for a $65 bill. The waiter was gone forever and some of us wanted to leave but were still waiting to pay. Luckily someone from our party had change. Will never go back here. Not a quality steakhouse at all. Your better off going to the Keg."

Eat with your hands or with the wooden (instead of plastic) utensils. Flavours are different, a bit over-powered by the raw red onions but interesting.  Service is attentive, and all dishes are explained to diners.  Very unique decor. No need to fight for parking out front as their is plenty of parking around the back and in the under-ground parking."

Although I don’t like to write bad reviews, since I normally just avoid the place after a bad experience, I dislike the fact that they get so many stars for their food quality and services. I ate there during late lunch hours, notably my husband and I the only customer, but still the food took forever to arrive. We both order the same drink (with alcohol) and my husband required a soda, drink arrive with no alcohol just a Virgin and no soda at all. Food was bland, no salt and pepper for taste. Pork chewy and more layers of fat than meat. Ox tails in peanut was just heat up in microwave, peanut sauce is bland. Rice is lukewarm at best, not streaming hot. Again, why not salt and pepper the chicken wings before batter and fried. That’s the basic. I’m Vietnamese so I regards street food often cheap and filling, although this is not Vietnamese food most Asian country run the same concept. But this restaurant over charge 2x more for worst quality than a take out Chinese food. Anyway I apologize if it’s too harsh but it’s just annoying that we had to seat through the whole dining experience."

Between the grilled calamari, the shrimp with spicy peppers, the filet of grouper, and the dry soup, I'm not even sure I could pick a favourite. You better decide for yourself -- go hungry."

Dinner for two at almost $300 and we are poured wine by the glass and do not get the bottle we ask for. The lobster risotto lacked authenticity and the single piece of calamari app seems mean. Our waiter dropped by from time to time but seemed focused elsewhere. Not a great anniversary dinner."

Food is always great, sometimes service is slow because of crowds.\nThis past visit, there was a slight mix up with service and we contacted them.  They bent over backwards to apologize for something minor, they will use it as a learning tool.  The owner called us twice to fully understand what happened and was more than generous.  To them, every customer must be completely satisfied.  Why can't every business be run like that ?\nNov 2017 made another annual visit.  Four of us went after gruelling all day conference and although it was a busy Sat night, we enjoyed ourselves.  We could carry on conversation without shouting, beer was cold and large size, food (tenderloin) was good as usual.  Will continue to visit on my Toronto trips."

The food and drinks were great, well presented and tasted fresh. The only downside was we felt very rushed. Our mains were brought out less than  30 seconds after we finished our starters and they cleared my main plate away whilst my partner was still eating. That's a No No in restaurants. Wait till all are finished before clearing. I suspect the wanted the table back. All in all it was a good experience."

The ambience is nice, the servers are friendly, and the food is quite good.\n\nI must say it was interesting to have an all you can eat buffet style brunch, with lots of eye-catching items you'd never expect, and I enjoyed myself.\n\nThis was my first time here, so I can't speak for regular days, but wow was it ever crowded! I know there's not much they could have done because of the holiday but it still coloured my experience.\n\nThe food here is delicious and excellent but you had better be prepared to pay for the privilege. Our bill for four people came just shy of $400; I didn't mind the price but it's something prospective diners should keep in mind.\n\nOverall a very positive experience. I will be returning when I have a special occasion to celebrate for sure."

We had a reserved table for four people but didn't really liked place we have been seated by host. Our waiter did his best to make us happy and arranged another table for us. It took less then 2 min even place was packed. Cafe was pretty busy during Sunday brunch time but no one bother each other at all. Everyone enjoyed food and company. Sommelier was very helpful and knowledgeable to  help us with choice of wine. Very much impressed."

Also, the chairs in the sunroom look nice but are not very functional.

The hummus with eggplant was really good that I forgot to take a picture. I guess I was a little hungry as well. \n\nThe chicken was okay. It wasn't spectacular but the flavours were good. It was just that the chicken was a bit dry. \n\nThe carrot cake ended the meal nicely. It wasn't your traditional carrot cake. This one felt light and airy and had more of a cupcake texture. It was delicious.  I may just have three of these for the app, main and dessert next time. Haha. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice and the service was good. The only thing that could be improved upon is a bit faster service but we weren't in a hurry so all is good."

The food was underwhelming - the egg was scotch but yolk was cold, potatoes were chewy, not in a good way, they doused the food with cream that was tasteless. I've had better and far cheaper meals at other places in Toronto. I do love the atmosphere in the Drake's restaurant, especially all the different kinds of lighting and the artwork upstairs and quirky bar. Our waitress was also hilarious and totally worth the visit, but it was her last day. My partner also had an average looking breakfast- she said it wasn't bad. Photos of our meals posted. Our friends had pancakes and I can't remember what else. No photos of their food taken. pancakes were colourful and pretty."

I ordered a tea cocktail and was shocked it's served in gorgeous tea cup!  For good my fiance ordered a beef dish and I ordered their daily special, risotto stuffed inside calamari.  Both were perfect and melt in your mouth.   For dessert we ordered their pb&j which is cake acting like bread with cake toppings acting like sandwich fillings to look like a sandwich.   It was creative and delicious and was served with a birthday card signed by all the staffs!  We enjoyed the experience here very much and would definitely come back!  The best part though! Our bill was under $60 after tax! Which is absolutely reasonable!  Look forward to trying the rest of their menu!"

The cooked to order selection was amazing and Chef Cory went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.. .\n\nThe wait staff. The staff here has little to no interest in serving you... at least during the brunch service.  They are no where to be found and you need to flag down others just to grab their attention.  Big time negative points.  \n\nLast note is the US exchange truly sucks here.   At current I can get 1.27 for the dollar...  I was only offered 1.15 and that was their special rate for hotel guests...  I will think twice next time returning to the area."

Our server(the biggest disappointment) was not very engaging, was only interested in taking our orders. He was not very proactive in recommending or even asking if we had any questions.

The only area for improvement is service. Although everyone was extremely friendly, especially the manager. Our table wasn't ready for 15-20 minutes even though we made a reservation. While we waited at the bar, they gave each one of us a drink on the house. Recommend to go on a weekend. Fun date spot or a night out with friends."

Fun part is you hit a button (Captain America's shield) and a door opens in the wall and you go through to the restaurant. \n\nIt is definitely is different on the inside, looks very upscale with tons of cool art on the walls (they won't let you take pictures of the art but it really is amazing).\n\nThey had a really intricate list of cocktails, I tried the Maleficent and Bramble Bee, both extremely delicious, like wow.\n\nWe tried the Beet salad which was also very delicious and the presentation was A plus, then we noticed a table next to us get this massive platter of sea food and meat and obviously we could not resist, it was not on the menu but the waitress mentioned it as their \"special\" . It was to die for, unreal and a must!!\n\nService was good, food took a little bit longer than I would like to come out, but they were very busy and it got really busier as the night went on. After dinner Figures turns into a lounge with really good music so we ended up staying late, it got really busy and apparently there was a celebrity in the house (although we didnt see anyone specifically).\n\nI will absolutely visit again.\n\nThanks!"

The reviews already posted are pretty accurate about service, speed, etc.\n\nThe kicker of the evening was when the waitress came back to the table after the service and asked each member of the group of 12 what they'd ordered over the past 3 hours. Presumably she spent the next 25 minutes trying to reconcile the receipts.\n\nUltimately:\n* Good, not great, food\n* Decent drinks\n* Slow, inattentive service\n* Obvious under-staffing issues in front and back of house\n\n* NOT good for groups\n\nThey need some serious help running a restaurant\n\nWon't be back"

Our waiter was very annoying, constantly making snide and somewhat inappropriate comments to us throughout the whole meal. At one point when we were eating, he stopped by our table to check up and noticed that my fiance was eating his food somewhat quickly and remarked \"wow, hope this isn't a first date\". We informed him that we were actually engaged and he said rather rudely \"really?\". A little more than halfway into our meal, our waiter, tried to take my plate away. I was only half way through my steak and hadn't even touched my pasta. He tried to take my food 3 more times when it was very clear I was still eating. When I was done, I had about half of my pasta left over and asked for a take out box. He said he would box it up for me in the back and took my plate away from the table. I then went to the washroom after paying and got distracted so we left. I forgot about my pasta! He never brought it back to the table in a box, even though we didn't leave until a good 15 minutes after he took it away. All in all, awful experience. The food wasn't even that good and the staff was very unprofessional. Don't waste your time coming here."

From helping us start planning the evening a year ago, to helping us bring everything in on Friday. When our rehearsal dinner space had a fire Chris saved us some tables so we could still have dinner, and of course thank you for everything you did the day of the wedding.\n\nThe food was amazing. It was the first time I ate at a wedding and all our gusts raved about how delicious the dinner was. \n\nYou did so much and it was such a special evening that we will remember forever. You and your staff are wonderful!\n\nThank you again,\n\nElizabeth and Alexander"

It took us nearly half an hour to get the attention of a waitress to put in our food order after we sat down.\n\nWhen the food did get to our table, the waitresses had no idea which end of the table got what order - making the process super confusing. It also didn't help that we didn't see the same waitress twice. We weren't sure who to ask for what. \n\nThe food itself was okay. The torched food items appeared cool and definitely Instagram worthy, but the torching didn't add any flavour to the dish. My friend loves this restaurant, so I'd probably come back for her... But I'll stick to another Izakaya."

I would fix up the place by hiring 1 server to work Friday and Saturday nights (the 2 busiest nights in the industry), 2 more people in the kitchen, and lowering the food prices by $2 on average and/or increasing the portion size. Overall a great experience, not perfect but still well done. Also get some desserts, you can make them in advance or outsource to a local bakery, and it can stay refrigerated for a few days, if not weeks! And typically, deserts are one of the most profitable menu items you can have, so why not!"

The waitress brought the chicken to the table and then asked me \"can you cut it open to see if it was cooked\" . That sent off read flags and had me thinking maybe I could cancel it as it had me second guessing myself. I just wished they took a little more time and maybe checked a piece themselves instead of asking the customer to do it. I don't think I'll be getting their chicken again."

In 3 months of work I only covered about 5 paid food events where we were not offered food or drinks and the payment was minimum wage. But I worked 8 hours, 5 days a week in Hawthorne without receiving any payment, without right to eat anything, and with a break of 15 min maximum. Pops where the only thing we could consume freely.\n\nAfter some weeks of training they believed I was capable enough for me to open or close the restaurant by myself. I did it. For several hours I was in charge of the whole restaurant by myself with 1 or 2 cooks until the trainer or another trainee came. So I was managing the whole front house by myself and not getting paid, or offered food and breaks longer than 15 minutes.\n\nI met people with quick learning skills, and at some point all those people were very disappointed with the course. Some of them did not continue the course, others like me, we had already lost so much that we had no choice but to stay and wait to see if at any moment the promises came true.\n\nAfter several months of my experience with this company, I got a job in a restaurant (without the help of is company) and the reality is completely different from what they do in Hawthorne. I get all the food I want to eat for just $4 per day. I get paid tips plus a salary. The training was just 3 days and it was paid. The break is 30 min every 5 hours of work, one hour every 8 hours.\n\nI did 2 courses with this company. Front of house and Guest services. I regret so much doing both courses. I would never get that time of my life back again.\n\nThis is all my personal opinion and experience and I wanted to post it so people are aware of it before starting losing their time.\n\nIf you are new in Toronto and thinking about starting one of this courses because you feel lost about where to start finding jobs in Toronto, send me a message. I’m not an expert, but I can give you my opinion on the matter and maybe make your life a bit easier."

I refused to even consider eating it. I didn't say another word.

The Lemon Drop was always a favourite of mine but now it's a bit like a martini you'd get at an East Side Mario's or something equally unimpressive. The food was okay but the service was not good. The hostess was lovely but the server was not happy to be serving. Everything was a chore for her and she didn't smile once. Lovely rooftop patio tho and great buzz!"

Seating within the cafe has been dramatically reduced, the always welcome potted plant on each table is gone, and refreshments are served in paper cups.  Considering the outstanding quality of food that the chef/kitchen has become famous for, this cosmetic change smacks of 'cost-cutting', not renewal. If I want cheap and cheerful, I'll walk down the hall to a fast-food joint. If I want a surprisingly delightful experience I will go to...Holt's, are you listening?"

There's also an omelette station and a cake stand. Service is good. The restaurant is packed for Sunday brunch. It's best to book a table for an earlier time. Seating can feel a bit cramped. Accessibility may be an issue with narrow passageways and a few steps up from the buffet area to some dining tables. There's underground parking, apparently $7 flat rate on weekends, but we never tried it. Overall, a great experience!"

The owner was a delight - friendly and spot on with his recommendations. I started with the Beef Carpaccio generously sprinkled with fresh grated Parmesan and my spouse had the colourful and flavourful Caprese Salad. For my entree we had the veal medallions Il Posto and veal chop. The portions were perfect and accompaniments were fresh, flavourful presented with creative flair. We didn’t have room for dessert but that didn’t stop us from ordering the chocolate banana meringue cake and a bowl of Amaretto ice cream. We are big fans of restaurants that can serve up traditional recipes with creativity and we were not disappointed. Thank you Sokol and chef for sticking around despite the weather."

When we got our bill they have decided upon himself to ADD 17% TIPS to it. I mean he actually fill in the credit card slips spots where it said tips and total. I was just so appalled and speechless. How can someone have the guts to do that!!!!!! Then I guess I know the reason why we were the only table that was there!

The only reason I am not giving five stars is that the server,although good and friendly,lacked basic knowledge of authentic Italian food-she tried to talk us out of a semolina-orange cake which we ordered anyway as we had a good understanding of regional Italian cooking and thought it sounded delicious;it was.

Nachos were interesting as they were deep fried squared puffs; the salsa sauce was a little bland. Linguine was pretty good except that the pasta was a little undercooked (i.e. it was pretty hard + chewy). Service and atmosphere was good. Other than that, worth a try, but expected more from this restaurant."

We were pretty hungry. \n\nI ordered the breaded Turkey and the Buffalo Mozzarella. Salad.  I thought the mozzarella salad was delicious with endive, drizzled vinegar and citrus.  Well balanced and lovely.  The Turkey, however, was a schnitzel which I was expecting more of a cordon blue.  Not much stuffing and the breading was too over powering to taste the truffle shavings.

The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. The reason I didn't give it more stars is we were there as a family celebrating a birthday and they sat us next to the door to the patio (it was cold that evening) and beside the cashier (my poor hubby kept having to move his chair). I don't know if this was because we had a small child with us and they wanted us away from other diners. I would understand this reasoning were it not for the fact that there was another family with a child in a stroller that was seated in the main dining area. Plus they charged us a $3 per slice fee to cut the cake we brought. They did a splendid job of serving the cake but I have brought cakes to restaurants for birthdays before (many, many times) and have never been charged a slicing fee. I can see if you bring a dessert in and it isn't a special occasion but for a birthday you would think they would be more accommodating. That being said, the food was very good and the atmosphere laid back which is nice for bringing families."

There was something on the menu for everyone though. \n\nMy meal of ribs were good. The mashed potatoes than came with them were a little bland, and I wished that the hot sauce had a little more heat to it. \n\nThe service was fantastic for our large group though and the venue itself was great. While it was the middle of winter we didn't get to enjoy the patio, but it seems like a great spot come summer time."

That night the blonde female waitress was excellent.\nAs a vegetarian I was impressed with the wide selection of options and found the food to be absolutely phenomenal and genuinely the nicest curry I've ever had.\nHowever tonight the food was great but found the male waiter to be way off the mark. 4 of us went in and were seated. I ordered a Guinness but was given a cider which I pointed out and it was immediately changed. When the waiter was taking our food order, halfway through the first member of our group ordering he interrupted and said something along the lines of \"hold on, order your dishes first and then tell me what nan bread you would like\". \nWhen our food arrived it was great, however twords the end of our meal we noticed we had recieved a huge amount of butter nan - when we pointed this out to the waiter he said \"that's what you asked for, I called the order back to you\", when we stated that we had only ordered one nan each he said \"yes, but I called the order back to you!\", (bit strange to argue with a customer) after we sat in silence for an awkward moment he said he'd take the extra nan off our bill. I think he made the mistake of writing the nan down twice when he asked for our dishes before our nans and confused the situation.\nWhen we were finished eating it took a while to get attention. We weren't offered tea or coffee or asked did we want a dessert menu. When we asked for separate bills he said \"ye should have told me it would be separate bills at the start\" and seemed annoyed about it. \nI'm sure it probably seems like I'm being very dramatic and hope I took him up wrong but his demeanour was wrong and it made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. \nIf I eat here again maybe it'll just be a takeaway unfortunately."

As you can see the soup was sitting in the kitchen too long, so it had a layer of “skin” when they served it to us. Presentation: 1/5. Beets were burned, they were completely black. I couldn’t tell it was a beet... and speed of service was very slow. We waited for 45 minuets to get our starters. And it was not busy at all. After starters, we had to wait another 45 minutes to get our steak and trout. Fish was dry and over cooked. Steak was excellent! 8/10. \n\nStaff was standing right between two tables and giving me a butt when he was talking to another table.... 🤦🏻‍♀️ \n\nFor those who need to park, make sure you park under tiff, it s only $7 after 5pm on weekdays.\n\nFood: 5/10\nEnvironment: 8/10\nValue: 3/10 \nLocation/ convenience: 10/10 \nServices: 4.5/10"

Foods that don't take a lot of time to prepare. 45 minutes later, along with the 20 minutes of waiting to get our drinks.  We still didn't have our food and we had to leave. There was no excuse for the poor, slow service. There were only 4 tables including ours! Then they had the nerve to charge us for all the food we didn't get!

My main concern was the service. I don't have terribly high standards but the host and wait staff were disorganized from the moment we showed up. Nobody offered to check our coats which is fine because the coat check is actually just a bunch of rolling racks in the public space outside of the restaurant. The host checked in a group of people who arrived after us and without a reservation, before showing us to our table where people were waiting. Our server didn't introduce herself, she just started talking over us to ask if we were ready to order. Left feeling underwhelmed."

Even though I did post a picture of the food; it doesn't do it justice as it was top class food for a reasonable price. \nThe highlight of the meal was the veal water buffalo.

Upstairs they have corner tables where the chairs are angled, making it a rather odd sitting arrangement for dinner. You end up looking at your dinner companion at weird angles or leaning away awkwardly when being served.\n\nService wasn't bad, our server was nice when we asked to be seated at a different table as I couldn't sit so awkwardly for the duration of the evening.\n\nWe did the Taste of Iceland menu, and this I have to say: the smoked salmon and arctic char trio were the highlight of the evening. I'd say the smoked salmon was one of the best tasting I've had anywhere.\n\nApart from that, food was presented nicely and tasted good, as were the wine pairings.\n\nAll in all, it's a place to go to if you don't mind the noise level. Nothing exceptional (smoked salmon not withstanding), but not terrible either, prices are on par with midrange restaurants downtown."

Staff was extremely nice and always making sure I was taken care of through the dining experience. It is always hard to judge/grade Italian restaurants since everyone has their own preferences on flavor of sauces. I felt they provided a Good flavorful selection for my tastes.

For example, the Caesar salad was not crisp but rather soggy with too much dressing; the salmon was overcooked and on the dry side even though I asked for it to be prepared medium. Overall the food was more on par with an East Side Mario's type of establishment (no slant against East Side Mario's) but not what we expected from LA's. On the positive side, the Minestrone soup was good and full of fresh vegetables. Based on this first time experience, I would not go out of my way to return to LA's."

We ordered a bottle of red, and had maybe 5 dishes. It came up to around $200. Just to give an approximation of price. Food was alright. I wouldn't say it was spectacular, but it was good. If price was a little more affordable, I'd go back."

Enough room to feel private but still experience the overall experience of the space.\n\nGranted, they were 2 days in to a new menu however my dish (The Duck) missed the mark.  The sausage and the overall salt content overpowered all of the other elements of the dish.  The duck was overly tough.  \n\nLooking forward to the opportunity to trying some other parts of the menu as I feel this may have just been an off dish.\n\nGreat overall experience."

We booked the private room for a group of 11 (of which ambiance wasn't great - it feels 'cold' and office-like - the table looks cheap and in need of work). We had the chef's appetizers selection which were mediocre at best - steak tartar on a toast (not a great selection for a group), veggie spring rolls and jerk chicken sliders. I then had the kale salad for my first course - it was the worst salad I had at a good restaurant ever! The leafs were soggy and it felt like the salad was sitting in the fridge with the dressing on for an hour or more. \nFor main I had a duck dish, which was the best part of the meal - it was well made and tasty. \nThen came the bill - we were charged for 12 people even though we were 11, as 'this is what the reservation'. We actually did send an email in the morning to update that we will be 11, but it shouldn't have mattered as the minimum order for the room is $800 and we spent well over $2000 - they insisted to have us pay for 12 and said that the events coordinator will contact us the next day and reimburse us the difference if all is fine.  That's awful customer service!"

It's what you hope your Indian food will taste like :) Loyal customer for life."

They taste like cheap grease, salt and stale spices with no hint of potato. Is it really so hard to boil some potatoes and fry them in good oil?\n\nThe rest of the cooked food I had had a film of grease on it and everything smelled like bacon. The Hollandaise sauce tasted very strongly of margarine. I haven't had this dish without fresh fruit in years. When you're paying $30 for a basic breakfast in a supposedly good hotel, this is not ok.\n\nThe people were nice, though.\n\nI went for dinner and it was pretty good, so I've averaged the review score.\n"

We were given great recommendations and had wine paired with our dishes which was really nice. The live music was really nice, and added to the already great atmosphere. Can’t wait to go back 😊"

We were a table of 4 that stumbled upon this gem because all the other fine dining seems to be booked up. We walked in expecting good things since reviews looked good online but we all know this is not necessarily true all the time. Being a high end steakhouse, the steaks held up to its name but surprisingly the pastas and apps did not lag behind at all. I have dined in some fancy restaurants in the past but from the owner to the servers, this place really go out of their way to please their customers and that itself makes it worth spending your money on. Thoroughly impressed and will make it back again!"

We simply wanted a spicy salmon roll, however we couldn't see it on the menu so we decided to ask our server if the chef can make us a spicy salmon roll off the menu. \nI would give a five star to only my server who name is Angela as she instantly provided all the services we needed with great smile. However, we were successfully disappointed by the spicy salmon roll ( or not even) The presentation of the plate looked great, yet the taste of food was quite a failure. The salmon meat was quite chewy and fishy, they probably used the worst part of the salmon ( the belly ) to make the entire dish, which means the salmon wasn't even cut properly. Ridiculously, they filled the roll with asparagus, we were both stunned by such a weird combination. Maybe the chef was trying to impress the guests with some creative ideas, or maybe it was just us who can't appreciate the taste. Anyways, It would have been much better if it was a regular spicy salmon roll. I was disgusted a while after as I could still taste the fishy flavor in my moth. \nWhen we requested our bill from another server, we were stunned again by her ruddiness as she only pointed her index finger to suggest that she will be with us soon as she was quickly passing by. Finally, one of the host lady with glasses came to us to collect the money with no facial expression or whatsoever. \nThe reason we came to this restaurant was because the 4.5 google review. Until this point,  for me this place is overrated by its fancy look, menu design, yet hardly see the value of food and service."

Food was excellent, all meat was cooked to perfection. If I had to find something to complain about, its that the menu seemed to lack a signature dish - there wasn't any over the top dish that completely knocks your socks off. \n\nWill definitely be adding this spot to my regular rotation."

My second visit I went with family and friends to watch the Peru vs New Zealand soccer game. The TVs were unsynced with the sound. We might as well have been listening to the radio because the image was much more delayed than the commentary. We had a long wait for our food and drinks. But we were trying to enjoy our night and watch the game with atmosphere. My friend waited over an hour for his food . He was promised to get comped for a plate. He offered to pay for half. When it was time to pay the owner came out and accused him of not being a man and lacking intengrity. He said if he did not have money, there is a Chinese buffet accross the street, but to never come back. He paid for the full sum to not place blame on the waitress. Overall, decent food if you know what to order. Would not recommend otherwise."

The menu doesn't have a whole lot on it, but everything we ordered, my party really enjoyed. The waitress was also really helpful in helping us navigate the menu, which was a little daunting with lots of words we didn't know. With her help we picked what was right for us, and everything is made to be so delicious and everything was nice and warm when it came out. The only down side was that not all of our dishes came out of the kitchen at the same time, so we had one person who was there with nothing in front of them while the rest of us were able to eat."

However, don't sit on the ground floor while on a date unless you want to sit with strangers. It follows a traditional sort of 'beer hall' seating arrangement that works for groups, but quarters are a bit tight if you're a couple. Ambiance is quite upscale, and doesn't quite fit the cuisine in my opinion. It's sort of takes you out of the experience while eating a heartier meal."

Sitting on the 2nd floor will give you a great spot for people watching and meal prepping. The noodles and the soup are on par with any top notch noodle places in T.O. Food comes not too long after ordering. Not pricey considering the location. Definitely a good pick for people working around the area or tourist looking for a unique place to refuel!!!"

I feel that Moxies doesn't have too much of a selection, its always the same limited menu.\nWent back for late night dessert and I’ve never been more disappointed with service. I understand it’s late at night and everyone wants to go home but there’s a way to speak to people, the waitress wearing a moxies tshirt told us she didn’t work there, then the bartender was being strange. Would I come here again? Not sure, not even the dessert could save my experience here."

For the main I got the the beef cheeseburger and the presentation of the plate was great but the taste wasn't the best. I can't put my finger on it why I didn't but it was just a strong uncomfortable taste. For dessert my father enjoyed the pecan pie. Also the waiters are on top of they're job also filling up my drink without me asking and around 10 minute wait for my food. My experience I give it 6.5 out of 10 but my family gave around 7.5/8 out of 10."

Do not be deceived by the outer appearance, the inside has a feeling of old New York. The food was delicious but the service was lacking. I do believe that was down to my specific server so I've still given a rating of 4. He was inattentive, slow, and when we were finished just sort of left us. No offer of coffees or dessert or the bill, he just sort of moved on to other tables. I would recommend!"

All the food was very fresh and delicious. It was simple but done perfectly which is what you expect in a nice restaurant. Service was on the ball and very pleasant.

The food was excellent too, but I thought the portion size of the chicken I had could've been bigger. Extremely fancy place with corresponding food prices. One thing however that wasn't so impressive was the men's washroom - I've seen much better in simple bar and grill restaurants. That was the main drawback of the experience."

The food was excellent, (although it could have been a little hotter). The staff were super. It was a buffet, so there was only one waiter in our section and he really was not much of a waiter. I asked for coffee 3 times before finally getting one, 45 minutes after our arrival. I was a little surprised and disappointed that refills on soft drinks cost extra. Parking cost extra too and 3 of the pay stations I tried were not working. Despite all of these little things, we had an excellent time and we will definitely be back. I highly recommend it."

If I'm meeting friends or family and they want to try it or it's conveniently centeally located then sure, I don't have strong objections, but the food isn't so great nor is the decor so stunning as to make me count down the minutes until my next visit.\n\nIf you know Bayview Village from back in the day, before its upscale renaissance, then you'd remember Max's was here, and frankly I liked that place way more (not that the quality of food was better -far from it, but rather it had a more family friendly casual happy vibe that O&B can't come close to replicating)."

        "text": "Our family usually visits this restaurant and we have noticed a decline in both their Staff and Management. This past Saturday( Nov 18, 2017) we decided, my wife and I to go for their brunch at 11am. We had made on line reservations and when we arrived we were welcomed and taken to our tables. Upon arriving at our table we were approached by our server and both of us requested to having hot water with lemon and we were still served with cold water until I brought our request to the server's attention a second time.My wife ordered the Smoked Salmon Croissant and I the Egg Benedict - the cheese scone on which they serve the poached eggs on was absolutely stale and \"dense\" and the home fries which my wife received were absolutely cold. So we brought this to the notice of our server. She explained that she would have to report to her manager on site. After a pretty long while the manager shows up with a tiny bowl of home fries and states that we found their fries cold so here is a replacement. No other talk to say that we are sorry that this occurred or anything else. This just showed us and confirmed in our minds on how their service was dropping."

Cold eggs Benedict and holondase sauce, I felt like the English muffins tasted hard and stale and my potatoes were so hard and undercooked. I was so incredibly hungry and tired (newborn at home) that I ate all of it and didn't say a word.  My husband did the same, i found out after. Also the plate just had the food slapped on so it didn't even look pretty. I was really surprised as I remember it being great food. \n\nI hadn't been here in years and I won't go back. They seem inconsistent based on all of the other great reviews."

        "text": "Had one of the worst experiences of price gouging that I’ve ever experienced in a restaurant of this reputation.  My husband and I ordered the bouillabais — a $32 per dish meal. It came out in a shallow bowl with 2 calamari rings, 2 small sized shrimp, 3 mussels (one did not open), and a piece of fish the size of a quarter on a bed of tomato sauce. The description of this meal stated that there were scallops and I could not find even one on my plate while my husband showed me the 6 tiny baby bay scallops he had in his dish. 2 pieces of toast were placed on top.  I wish I had taken a photo as proof that this is no lie. I think OB should be ashamed.  Our $14 calamari appetizer had more food than both main meals put together and the $22 a plate seafood spaghettini I ordered on two prior visits in the past few weeks had more seafood on the bed of pasta than this $32 sauce with a few morsels of food. We went home hungry and perplexed.  Our waiter was amazing and friendly and saved our evening so this rating is only about the food."

        "text": "Today, I went there with my family for a casual afternoon meal. Got a table inside, ordered some drinks, my wife and my daughter ordered two Cesar salads from the first course menu, and a linguine and spaghetti from the pasta menu. I skipped the first menu and ordered instead a chicken shawarama from the second course menu. Now, here happens the funny thing. Apparently in the name of \"One Restaurant tradition\", one cannot order from second menu before ordering the first menu. Two salads arrived at our table in about 25 minutes. I waited another ten minutes, then tried to get the attention of the passing waiters, all ignoring me. Flies and wasps were more attentive than waiting staffs. Finally, a server came and I asked for my dish. Here was his answer to me: \"We usually serve the second course after everyone finishes the first course\". I said please bring my dish now. In another 10 minutes, a staff from the kitchen brought my dish, with two pieces of totally burnt and charred pita bread resting in the side of my plate. I asked the avoiding server to my table, protesting about the state of my dish, and I was told: \"Why don't you start your dish and I send for some more bread\". My jaw dropped in awe, no apologies, nothing. Aside from the charred pieces of bread, the saffron rice was not fresh, didn't even have the saffron taste or aroma. Then arrived the pastas, no offering of additional Parmesan cheese or pepper, a standard courtesy at any restaurant. Apparently we were getting the full package Canadian hospitality. My appetite was ruined by then. I paid around $200 and a 15% tip. I called the restaurant later to address my complaints to the management. She suggested next time better communicate with my server. I hung up the phone."

Meze usually consists of mainly pre-prepared appetizers. However, the meat should have been warmer, the burek more cheesy and one of the dips was too salty. The happy ending (dessert) made up for everything, however."

Chef/Partner Dustin Gallagher, recently of Top Chef Canada All-Stars, helms the kitchen with a menu driven by ‘crunch-to-squish ratio’, fun-to-eat, punchy-flavoured, technique-driven dishes. The bar program by managing partner, Matt See, includes carefully chosen beer, wine and cocktail lists which round out Peoples Eatery’s offerings. Dining at the bar or in a number of private spaces for larger groups makes Peoples a distinctively unique restaurant in an unexpected location: look for candle light in the front windows."],

I know it’s not great for restaurants to accommodate a stroller, so I don’t don’t go when the restaurants look busy. Fortunately I find most places try to accommodate and I appreciate that. \n\nNot this place it seems. I saw that it is empty with only 3 tables and saw empty tables with floor space before I decided to go in. I took the stroller through the first door and wanted to see if any staff would come open the second door for me since it’s a very cramped space between the doors, but both staff standing in front of the door chose to ignore me. At first I thought they were helping a lady so I waited, but when that lady left, they turned their backs (while still standing 3 feet away from me) despite seeing me at the door staring at them. It’d be hard for them to not notice me and the stroller being that close. No one acknowledged me during the 5-10 minutes while I stood there. I would appreciate it if they just tell me they can’t accommodate a stroller instead of pretending I’m not there."

The pizza is so cheaply put together, that the topping portions are so small you either miss them or cannot taste them! The crust is so dry and I'm flavorful. Drinks are highly over priced, and thank god I'm pregnant and can't drink, cause the two drinks my husband ordered cost more then our actual meal! In end our pizza was probably the worst I've ever eaten and we eat a lot of pizza... there just was no flavour from the toppings we wanted (cause they make they so small) sauce was gross. Service was great and that was about it, we will never go back and these guys need to learn how to make a real \"rustica\" pizza or change there name"

I went there for my birthday with some wonderful friends and I am so honoured to have been able to do so. \n\nWords fail to impress just how magical the food was. It is, hands down, the best Indian cuisine that I have ever had in my life. The food is prepared with true love and artistry, and the exquisite balance of spices is almost surreal. Proteins were all cooked to perfection, and the service was impeccable.\n\nThe server was professional, attentive without being intrusive, and the owner delivered us our appetizers with a humility and pride befitting of his craft. When I mentioned that it was my birthday, the owner gifted the table a beautiful slice of decadent dark chocolate torte that sat upon a drizzle of the most incredible cardamom infused butterscotch.\n\nI cannot sing this restaurant's praises enough. I will certainly be returning and encourage anyone that is reading this to treat yourself and the ones you love to a quasi-spiritual experience of food."

The restaurant is very charming.  However, our waitress was not.  She was snippy and seemed to be in a bad mood.  From the moment we sat down we felt rushed. She wanted us in and out. We ordered champagne and after she poured us our first glass she asked us if we were ready to order. When we said we wanted to just relax a bit with our drinks she made one of many faces we had to endure during our meal. She spoiled what should have been a fun afternoon.  In retrospect I should have asked to be moved to another section."

We ordered calamari to start which was okay, we wish the pieces were smaller as it made it hard to eat. For mains we order the lobster pappardelle, beef tenderloin and shortribs; the lobster dish and steak were perfectly executed while the short rib left a lot to be asked for.

Once there, we waited 40 minutes to place our food orders, during which time two of us who arrived a bit later than the others ended having to go to the bar to get drink service.  When the food finally came, the orders were staggered, with some of us getting food, and some not, and some orders not completed (\"soup and salad\" means soup and salad together, not soup and eventually, maybe, salad, 10 minutes after you've finished your soup).  The service was pleasant enough, but when you've got an hour for lunch before you have to get back to a meeting, and make reservations ahead of time to make sure that everything goes smoothly, you'd hope for more timely service."

Great service and solid place to visit for special occasions. Food tastes fresh and amazing!\n\nHighly recommend!"

Very beautiful with an open kitchen area so you could see chefs at work. Our server was a friendly, professional guy with a cool mustache that offered suggestions based on his experiences.\nThey started us with some red pepper dip and an assortment of breads, which was very nice. The food itself was brought out decently quickly and tasted great, although the portions were pretty small. The presentation of the mains was beautiful. The quality was present even in the receipts, which were attached to a custom Ricarda's postcard. \nIf you are looking to eat a lot when considering the price and the portion sizing, I would suggest looking elsewhere. If not, then this is a very cool experience in a great setting with high-quality dishes."

The decor is tastefully curated, in a non-pretentious way. Even the lobby is upscale. \n\nThey served us bread with a red pepper hummus which I'm glad I didn't fill up on, because I had the lobster roll (3) with skinny fries and loved every bite. My table also ordered off the tapas menu to sample the meatballs and caprese salad, which was a whole lot of hype for not very much food. The service was fantastic and our waitress was one of the most attentive people I've ever met. We totally overstayed our welcome but she was gracious and let us chat long after we had finished our meals. For that, I might be back to try their bakery."

It was my first time at this restaurant and I chose it based on web reviews and the fact it was conveniently located for both my friend and I. While it was ok overall, I was hoping for a better experience.  Firstly, the restaurant was virtually empty despite it being around 7pm.  There was no soft background music either so it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.  Too quiet actually.  The menus were a bit stained and \"worn\" looking.  That would not have bothered me if it was a low-end restaurant, but given Boccaccio's price point, this should not have been the case. We shared the fried artichokes and they were very good, although I was expecting fresh artichokes vs canned.  Nonetheless, they were tasty and we enjoyed them.  I had the gnocchi and while the gnocchi themselves were soft and light (definitely homemade), the tomato sauce was a bit acidic. Almost like it was under-cooked.  My friend had the daily fish special.  It was cooked perfectly and she said it was delicious. I had the creme brullee for dessert.  It was ok.   The service was good.  Wait staff was very professional and attentive. They knew exactly when to come and fill water glasses and ask if we needed anything.  So overall it was ok but I will not be coming back as I have other Italian restaurants in the city that I enjoy more both for ambiance and food."

The lack of knowledge some servers have on the menu items as well as not giving us any cutlery/condiments with our appetizers really ruined the experience for me. If you ever come here for lunch be prepared to be out for 3 hours. An hour for the drinks, an hour for the food, and an hour in between paying the bill.\n\nEDIT: Came back to Safari for dinner after this experience. I feel service was greatly improved and I’m surprised they’ve spruced up some of the specials. Safari offers a wider variety of red and white wines. Cashing out our bill did take a while, I feel that this can be improved."

I thought it seemed odd that one of the ingredients is onion, but I figured I could just pick them off if i don’t like it... wrong!   It doesn’t taste bad but management should definitely consider renaming it because it’s deceiving."

I walked up to the door this eveing and the gentleman working literally locked the door in front of me. When I said \"Are you not open until 10?\" The response was \"we're closed\" and a turned back. Great food when the time comes, But service can ruin an experience in a moment. If you're are based on service and service is refused... not sure what the point is.

She ordered the Angus burger and told the waitress about her dietary needs.  The waitress assured us that the burger contained none of the allergens and would specifically talk to the kitchen about her allergy.  Then came the food and everything was fine until my friend found a piece of avocado in her burger.  Luckily she didn't eat it, but we were shocked and upset with it.  Especially when we had specifically told them about the allergies. We called our waitress over right away and she was very apologetic about it.  She offered to cover the cost of the burger and asked if my friend would like to order something else.  Honestly at that point, none of us felt like eating anything anymore.  We asked to speak to the manager just to make sure they are aware of the severity of this error.  Our waitress was very helpful and went to look for him immediately.\n\nHe came and we told him that we just wanted to let him know about the problem.  He offered his apology and to cover the cost of the burger.  We asked him if he checked with the kitchen to see how could this have happened.  His simply said the kitchen was busy.  Yes, I understand the kitchen was busy but that shouldn't be the excuse.  To us he simply wanted to brush us off and not deal with the real issue. \n\nAnyway by then my friend started to feel funny and we all decided to leave. The waitress came back to offer dessert on the house, but we didn't want to stay.  Then they came out to give us another burger as a gesture of goodwill...I guess the kitchen felt bad but honestly none of us wanted to take it as we didn't want to be reminded of the burger incident.  However we felt bad in wasting food, so we took it but gave it away.\n\nThis is the worst birthday lunch. Not because of the food, not because of the error, mostly the way how the manager handled the situation.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.  \n\nI give it one star because the waitress was good."

We even had a girl that did not know us and saw the whole situation and said it was not our fault.

We were, by coincidence, seated @ the 'Table 21', which was an added touch. The cocktail, 'Blushing Bride', was made to perfection, my main meal was cod, very tender, juicy, no bones, (an important factor for me to have no bones in my fish) and the potatoes were cooked to perfection, plenty of taste & crispy!  The wine I selected was followed by a compliment & story by the 'Sommelier', which was a very interesting story about the owner of the vineyard.  Highly recommend this fine restaurant & I certainly could give more than five stars for service and food.  Thank you for a wonderful restaurant experience.  Wishing you more of your success!!!!

The system asks if we are celebrating anything and even allows one to tick off 'birthday' 'female' etc. We also entered that we were celebrating our mom's 75th birthday and would like a nice table, if possible. We were seated in the downstairs area, it looked fine, I wasn't going to complain. It seemed  nice and the server we had was excellent. Just as the server started taking our drink order, the live music started. She cringed and said, unprompted, 'I'll ask him to turn it down'. We thanked her. We saw her motion to him to turn it down AND we asked two more times over the next half hour if it could be turned down, explaining we could barely talk to each other. It was never turned down. To be fair, the guy was a good singer and it would have been a very nice addition to the atmosphere if it was a reasonable volume or acoustic. (actually acoustic would have created a lovely, classy atmosphere as it's not a large restaurant). I'm going to guess that we weren't the only ones not enjoying it as people were not clapping at the end of his songs. \nThe food was excellent but there is excellent food at many restaurants where you have have a more pleasant, enjoyable time and talk to your companions. Also, I don't understand why their reservation system asks if you're celebrating anything when they don't acknowledge it. Bottom line, I doubt we'll be back, we did not leave feeling happy."

As a young professional, I automatically thought of Office Pub when looking to book a friendly Christmas lunch for 15 people. I called the morning of, and they accommodated to my needs. Arriving at the pub, I was greeted by friendly staff, after we sat down I realized some of my colleagues could not make it to lunch and by some I meant 4 guests!!! The staff quickly turned on us, as they demanded we moved to a new table by the door ( side note: December in Toronto is freezing cold). I kindly asked if they would allow us to keep our seats and just move the extra table, but they instead they told us the only option is if we pay $20.00 per head that didn’t show up. I was appalled at the condescending comment, I felt so angry at the lack of service presented to a group of 10 people. I am never going back to the office pub and now I know why they’re never busy."

The belly dancing show is 15 - 20 minutes and if it's not too busy, the dancers go to each table and invite people to join them in dancing, which makes for a few laughs. Very traditional food, decor, and music which made for a great atmosphere, definitely unlike any other restaurants located downtown. Expect it to lighten your wallet, but overall a great experience."

But she didn't bring it for 10 minutes so my friend thought she forgot it and ordered again. Then it took her another 10 minutes to bring the drink though she was chatting with her co-workers.\nWhen we asked for our bill, we were charged 3 beers that we didn't order. So we claimed that that was not our order, however, she insisted that we asked her to buy the beers to the guys at the counter and the way she explained so was very rude and unprofessional.\nWe were so shocked and disappointed with her. She ruined our pleasant Friday night and we will never come back even though we liked the place :("

Service has always been great too. Highly recommend getting the tasting menu, which is amazing value for money.

From what I remember, the food was good. We went on a Friday or Saturday night and the ambience was the most memorable part of the meal. They have a DJ playing good music and nice mood lighting. \n\nUnfortunately my experience on my recent visit was not as good. While our server was friendly, she almost entirely forgot about our table. We waited for almost 15 minutes for the POS terminal before paying cash (no tip) and walking out. Food was not outstanding either considering the pricing. We had their fried chicken special, but the batter on both variations we ordered barely stuck to the chicken. \n\nTLDR: One good and one bad experience. Decent food and supbar service."

        "text": "A very disappointing night, but we made the best of it and enjoyed some fine company and good cheer together.\n\nMy review is quite delayed, though I have been meaning to write this for some time.\n\nMy elderly parents live in Bruce County and came to visit me and my husband to have Thanksgiving in the city.  We were excited to host them here because we usually do it at their place up north.  However, due to unforeseen circumstances, as the weekend drew closer, it became clear that we were not going to be able to host it in our home so we had to find another venue to enjoy Thanksgiving with my parents.\n\nThere weren't a lot of places open that weekend, so we wound up choosing to go to Toula.  We thought that this would be a remarkable place to share Thanksgiving together.  Living downtown, it had the added benefit of being able to park there, which was a very important feature for my parents who can not walk long distances.\n\nIt'd been years since we had all gone there, but we all remembered it very fondly, with it's revolving view of the lake and city, the wonderful food and that \"X\" factor you have when something has a special experience associated to it.\n\nToula is also connected to a hotel, which we thought would almost guarantee that there would be a Thanksgiving-oriented menu to choose from.  I should have confirmed that in advance. You know what they say about assuming.  In any case, that was one of our several disappointments for the evening.\n\nSo, we arrived, granted, with high expectations for a lovely evening. \nWell, at least we had each other, and that was enough to be thankful for.\n\nWe arrived at the hotel to park our car, $25 right away for parking.  Fine.  We figured the night would be worth it.\n\nWe arrived at Toula and were seated right beside a not terribly exciting view of an old, brutalist cement condo building, which again we thought would be fine, because the restaurant revolves and soon we'd be facing the lake or other more attractive parts of the city.\n\nNope.  Not revolving.  Hasn't in years. Brutalist cement condo views are all the rage now apparently.  Welcome to the big city Mom & Dad.  Hope you enjoy our finest views.  \n\nFine.  We know the food will be great.  Bring on the turkey.\n\nNope.  Not turkey. Not stuffing. No cranberry sauce. Not even mashed potatoes. No Thanksgiving menu to be found....in a hotel restaurant.  Surprised, and disappointed, the blame is my own.  Note to self, call ahead to confirm things for special occasions.\n\nSo, we find things on the menu that we thought we'd like.  The sad truth is, even that too, priced as it was for fine dining, was anything but.  We found our food cold and flavourless.  Perhaps they gave the head chef the night off as well. Good for them if they did.  Too bad for us.\n\nWell, we had wine, and we toasted each other and decided to make the very best we could of this night because that is what it was about.  \n\nBut wine has a way of travelling through you, so eventually, dad, unfortunately very frail, needed to use the facilities.  When he asked someone where they were, they pointed him to a stairwell he could take to a restroom on a lower floor.  He stressed that he was fairly disabled and asked if there was not a restroom on the main floor he could use. No, no restroom. Go downstairs sir. The restroom is downstairs.\n\nI would have held it and stewed in anger myself.  Not my dad. Fortunately, he had the wisdom to approach another staff member who was kind enough to escort him to a staff restroom on the main level (i believe in the kitchen), but beggars can't be choosers.  I was just glad that he finally found an appropriate option.\n\nI won't even get into the size of the bill considering what we had, but none of us felt the value was there. Weren't we thrilled that we paid $25 to park there to enjoy this night?\n\nWhatever charm Toula held for us in the past, it is sadly not ever going to be part of our future.  Good luck to you if you go.  Ask for the lake view. You'll get it all night."

The chicken my mother ordered tasted like day old chicken, the lamb was inedible and hard to cut, never mind chew, and when we requested an alternative, we were told that they had nothing for us at all, despite having been informed of the allergies. The staff was very unapologetic, and were, in fact, quite rude. The inedible lamb was barely touched and yet the item appeared on the bill, even after it was brought to management's attention. Our entire experience was incredibly unsatisfactory. We are season ticket holders for Mirvish, are always entertaining out of town guests and are constantly looking for good places to go to dinner. We will not be going back. In fact, we will be letting everyone know exactly how rude and ignorant the staff truly is.

I've eaten there 4 times because I enjoyed the food. However the last time we waited over an hour for our food...at 3 in the afternoon. It was impossible to flag down a server. The restaurant was not full and there were 5 staff running around but not really serving. It was very disappointing. Although the food is good I won't be going back. The poor service ruins the meal."

The chef clearly put a lot of time in creating his dish as all the flavours were in absolute harmony, and I don't say this lightly, this is a very hard task to accomplish. Everything tasted like it belonged there: the sweetness of the maple glaze on the chicken was beautifully balanced with pepper flavours from perfectly blanched kale, a carefully-chosen mushroom species, and wilted cabbage. Furthermore, the execution was great; the chicken was tender and juicy and the vegetables are wilted to an ideal amount of crunchiness. To top it all off, my waiter and all service staff were courteous and exceptionally welcoming. The only thing I would change is the layout of the restaurant, ideally it would be completely secluded from the lobby and have a lower ceiling to give a more intimate feeling, but this wasn't terribly distracting, ad the food and the service were so good, I wouldn't hesitate to give it 5stars. Finally, yes this is more expensive than the average restaurant, you won't get a meal for under $20, however you are paying for quality that is miles higher than your average restaurant."

GET THE SHORT RIBS!!! \nOur lovely server Holland couldn't stop raving about them so naturally we had to try them.

However, upon arriving at the restaurant, we still had to wait for 20 minutes before we got seated which was tough because there isn’t really standing space in the restaurant and we had to constantly move out of the way of severs and customers.\n\nPretty good food, specializing in seafood and vegetarian dishes. Service was good for the most part expect it too the server close to 30 minutes to split the bill. Overall, I would recommend it for large parties but leave plenty of time if you need separate bills."

The waiter came around 12.10 and we were about to order. One of our guys asked if we could order from the express instead the menu as he had a meeting at 1.00pm. The waiter cautioned that the space reserved was for menu orders only but since were already there and not all of us were to get express he would allow us. As some were getting ready to go to the express, and i was about to taste the bread the manager came up and ordered all of us out of the reserved space to the area where express takeout patrons sit. This was a farewell occasion to one of our colleague. I got disgusted the way the manager treated and walked out. I go for lunch to Vagabondo once in a way. Will not step into this place that lacks basic courtesy and hospitality."

Rave reviews for all four - fresh, delicious, hot, and cooked to perfection. In addition, the carrot, pear and coconut soup was excellent as was the Caesar salad.  Dessert was included in the fixed prix menu and was not exceptional, but was good, and there were a couple of a la carte desserts (e.g. crème brulee) that we could have ordered for a little more $$. Valens offers fixed prix dinners throughout the year at $30 and kept NYE dinner at $30 as well - unheard of in Toronto!"

When there's a big part they should know that people will sometimes change places/seats and they made a bit of a  fuss about that. I have served for 10 years and you have to have a good memory. I get it that it is \"easier\" when people stick to their seats but in bigger parties its most likely that it will happen and you have to be prepared and not be sour about it.  The other thing that i DID not like/appreciate was not being advised that they would charge to cut the cake that was brought in. They should've advised the person that made the reservations of the charge and let the person make the choice or not. They pretty much charged $5.00 per person for them to cut the cake. So that for me was a big DEAL. You are not going to make your guest pay for birthday cake. They should give the choice instead of charging without notice. And because of that i'm only giving it a 3 star."

        "text": "My review is \"not fair\" as I have yet to eat (and properly experience) this local restaurant, however as I (and many other likely do as well) looked through some reviews that had been left I became less (and less) interested in giving a shot (though I still may - it's just not something I'm rushing to do). \n\nThe reason for this review is to try and help the owner - and by extension patrons / would be diners (or persons responding to other guests reviews), as while most of the reviews are encouraging, the person responding to any \"lacklustre\" reviews seems to take a conciliatory tone, yet (like many others, just typically not those who consider their establishment to be \"fine dining\") lacks a candid acknowledgement of the shortcomings some found (in their attempt to provide others with details of their experience). Instead, \"excuses\" are made (and poorly masked as a response). Most \"fine dining\" establishments that thrive or survive in the vicinity (and most big cities) pander to their customers - present, future and past, without making a point to compare with \"most restaurants\" (both as they feel no need and want to set themselves apart in a positive manner) or giving a lecture to customers who have a mixed experience. \n\nThe customer is always right is a well known saying for good reason (the majority know this is far from true, though the underlying reasoning of needing to satisfy their customers - and continuing to do so is... most can fill this in). A patron is not \"wrong\" for not knowing certain things about a particular restaurant (or neglecting to make certain inquiries) and whether or not \"other\" places have similar protocols (which is a false assertion in and of itself - the majority both \"want to\", and \"do\" set themselves apart). \n\nI am but just \"one\" (well usually 2 and upwards of 20) customers - and would have made it a point to try this neighbourhood restaurant, as it looked quite good). If not for the tone taken towards other customers (including a PARTY - numerous potential repeat customers) by the person responding (presumed to be the owner or other key person involved in their operations), choosing to not only be dismissive of their stated criticism (good businesses consider this valuable \"feedback\"), but specifically makes a point of \"what\" each reviewer had done \"wrong\" / \"should have known\". A word of advice is you'd likely see more success (and ensure future success) by taking one of the following approaches - say \"nothing\" (no one can be put off - many don't see these reviews or are more traditional and not knowing much about the digital age) - use a \"canned response\" (they're pretty cheesy but many seem to get by just fine saying \"Thanks for your feedback. It helps us provide even greater service!\") - or if responding, be candid (which in this case seems overly candid, as that attitude is off putting) and if responding to specific criticisms either placate the customer (to retain them and have them say positive things regarding the way an issue got handled) or at minimum just acknowledge it in a \"non-arrogant\" manner. I might have been one of your new \"best customers\", though now that depends on whether or not I choose to try your fine dining some time in the future (as a lot can be taken away from \"tone\" and message conveyed - this is particularly for local / non franchise or big chain restaurants as it gives a preview into the manner the restaurant is run and what to expect should any issue arrive). \n\nBest of luck."

Table sever has good product knowledge, made the birthday girl feel special and was attentive to my husband's water glass once he realized how much he drinks. The food was exactly what you expect from a restaurant of that quality. Portion sizes were perfect if not generous. Timing of apps to main course was very good.

The 7 of went in and our server Ty and the team made sure my friend had the best birthday ever! We had several beverages - all amazing. Apps we had the baby gem salad and devil's horseback. Our shareable main was the Whole Curry Braised Lamb Shoulder which came with several sides. We also had the steak and roasted cauliflower. My greatest fear was that a plate would come out and not be as amazing as the plate before, but everything from start to finish was phenomenal. We finished it off with a Knickerbocker Glory sundae. This is my new favourite restaurant. Any food I've ever had is now substandard in comparison. Thank you for a night I will never forget."

This restaurant is basically a can't miss because it has big yellow doors as a grand entrance.  As soon as you walk in you can tell it has a hipster vibe to it and everyone is super friendly as you walk in.  Make sure you make a reservation because it could get filled up pretty quickly in here. As soon as you walk in you''ll see how dark it is in there and how it works because you can still have good conversations even with all the noise. The interior design is very detailed and sophisticated enough to dress up here; but you could definitely come in here with a pair of nice sneakers.  From the cowboy saloon/hipster/hunter feel to this restaurant, Weslodge pulls it off. \n\nThe service is top notch and if you get Bryce as your waiter you'll be going in and out happy.  We got the burger and fish and chips with a traditionally awesome Stella and it was cooked to perfection.  If you look at the menu you might be enticed by the share aspect of the menu which include having a whole chicken, fried chicken or duck.  We didn't get a cocktail but I know this place is very well known for their astounding cocktails so give it a try! Overall, this place is A1."

After being seated we waited nearly 20 mins for a server to come see us, my table mate had to flag down the manager and ask for a server, who knows how much longer it would have been if she had not. \n\nBased on other reviews that seems about the typical experience. \n\nThat being said, the food everyone ordered was amazing. Like the Nutella french toast and I had the Florentine Benedict, which comes with a parmesan fondue that beats boring old hollandaise everyday. Their cappuccino was nice, and the mimosa my friend had was strong and delicious unlike most brunch places where that is usually the weakest point. \n\nThe decor is really so sweet and special, like your best friend's first rental, there is fairy lights, and a drafty but authentically lush and well decorated outdoor patio, a shabby modern industrial aesthetic that makes you feel cozy and cool."

        "text": "The only reason I didn't give Yuzu 5 Star rating was due to the Manager they employ. She was so rude & condescending to all the staff & I could hear her berating them too. Why & how she is Manager of such a lovely place with such exceptional, hard working staff is beyond me? She looks like she's constantly in a bad mood & a dark cloud following her. The service was truly great, the food was excellent & the decor is simple but elegant. Very comfortable place to take family or a date too. Again, the experience was exceptional, with the exception of the Manager on duty. She does not deserve to be a Manager anywhere tbh! If she's there the next time I visit, I'm leaving & taking my business elsewhere! "
